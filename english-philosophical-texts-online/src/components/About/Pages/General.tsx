    <h2>General Information</h2>
    <p>
      <i>English Philosophical Texts Online</i> is part of a project that aims
      to provide high-quality digital editions of a broad canon of English
      language philosophical works published in Britain between 1650 and 1830,
      to make them freely available in one place, and to provide intuitive
      software for performing sophisticated searches and computational analyses
      of these works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roughly 40% of the target works have already been digitised, through
      projects like the{" "}
      <a href="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/">
        Text Creation Partnership
      </a>
      , the <a href="http://oll.libertyfund.org/">Online Library of Liberty</a>,
      and <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>. However,
      these works can be difficult to locate unless you already know where to
      look, and the fact that they are spread out over multiple sites prohibits
      systematic searching and comparative computational analysis. Furthermore,
      the editions on these sites do not include universal paragraph references,
      making them of limited use to historians of philosophy. By combining these
      works with new digitisations of as many other works again, including
      several by often neglected female writers, we hope to provide a lasting
      scholarly resource of unparalleled size in this field.
