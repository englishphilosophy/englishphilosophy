    <h2>Corpus Details</h2>
    <p>
      The corpus on this site contains several English-language philosophical
      texts published in Britain between 1650 and 1830. The aim is to provide
      free and high-quality digital critical texts for all of the works in this
      corpus, alongside tools for performing sophisticated searches and
      comparative textual analyses. Note however that this project is still in
      the early stages. So far there are texts by{" "}
      <a href="/astell">Mary Astell</a>, <a href="/berkeley">George Berkeley</a>
      , <a href="/butler">Joseph Butler</a>, <a href="/conway">Anne Conway</a>,{" "}
      <a href="/drake">Judith Drake</a>, <a href="/hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a>,{" "}
      <a href="/hume">David Hume</a>, <a href="/hutcheson">Francis Hutcheson</a>
      , <a href="/locke">John Locke</a>,{" "}
      <a href="/mandeville">Bernard Mandeville</a>,{" "}
      <a href="/masham">Lady Masham [Damaris Cudworth]</a>,{" "}
      <a href="/norris">John Norris</a>, and{" "}
      <a href="/shaftesbury">Lord Shaftesbury [Anthony Ashley Cooper]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The selection is based on the following general considerations:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Works should be originally published in English. This restriction is
        necessary because of the kinds of computational linguistic analyses we
        want to run, which only make sense applied to a single language. Hobbes
        and Conway necessitate bending this rule slightly. We have included the
        English versions of Hobbes’s works that he himself published (even if he
        published a Latin version first), but excluded his Latin works that were
        only translated posthumously. The original English manuscript of
        Conway’s <em>Principles of Ancient and Modern Philosophy</em>,
        meanwhile, does not survive. It was first published in a Latin
        translation, then posthumously translated from the Latin back into
        English; we have included this third-hand English text, for want of
        anything better.
      </li>
      <li>
        Works should be philosophical in a suitably broad sense, given the
        period, and consequently the list includes many works on what we would
        now consider more as theology or social science. We have even included
        two histories of England (Hume’s and Macaulay’s), but only because of
        the independent philosophical interest in these writers; we are not
        including histories more generally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Works should be written by a known British author (the highly
        influential Dutch-born immigrant Mandeville being a partial exception to
        this rule). This is simply to keep things within reasonable bounds.
        Works by unknown authors or North American writers could be added in the
        future. (This is why—with apologies to the Irish, Scottish, and Welsh—I
        have called this site <em>English</em> Philosophical Texts Online, and
        not <em>British</em> Philosophical Texts Online. As with the similarly
        titled <em>Early English Books Online</em>, it is to the language and
        not the nation that we are referring.)
      </li>
      <li>
        The collection should include adequate female representation, with a
        minimum target of 20%. Happily that target is being comfortably exceeded
        at present.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We welcome suggestions for additional works of interest that we may have
      missed. Particularly welcome are works by neglected or forgotten female
      philosophers.
