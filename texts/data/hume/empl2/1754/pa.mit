DISCOURSE X.

_Of the Populousness of Antient Nations_[n1].

THERE is very little ground, either from reason or experience, to conclude the universe eternal or incorruptible. The continual and rapid motion of matter, the violent revolutions with which every part is agitated, the changes remark'd in the heavens, the plain-traces as well as tradition of an universal deluge or general convulsion of the elements; all these prove strongly the mortality of this fabric of the world, and its passage, by corruption or dissolution, from one state or order to another. It must, therefore, have its infancy, youth, manhood, and old age, as well as each individual form which it contains; and 'tis probable, that, in all these variations, man, equally with every animal and vegetable, will partake. In the flourishing age of the world, it may be expected, that the human species should possess greater vigour both of mind and body, more prosperous health, higher spirits, longer life, and a stronger inclination and power of generation. But if the general system of things, and human society of course, have any such gradual revolutions, they are too slow to be discernible in that short period which is comprehended by history and tradition. Stature and force of body, length of life, even courage and extent of genius, seem hitherto to have been naturally, in all ages, pretty much the same. The arts and sciences, indeed, have flourish'd in one period, and have decay'd in another: But we may observe, that at the time when they rose to greatest perfection amongst one people, they were perhaps totally unknown to all the neighbouring nations; and tho' they universally decay'd in one age, yet in a succeeding generation they again reviv'd, and diffus'd themselves over the world. As far, therefore, as observation reaches, there is no universal difference discernible in the human species: and tho' it were allow'd, that the universe, like an animal body, had a natural progress from infancy to old age; yet as it must still be uncertain, whether, at present, it be advancing to its point of perfection, or declining from it, we cannot thence presuppose any decay in human nature[n2]. To prove, therefore, or account for the greater populousness of antiquity, by the imaginary youth or vigour of the world, will scarce be admitted by any just reasoner. These _general physical_ causes ought entirely to be excluded from that question.

THERE are indeed some more _particular physical_ causes of great importance. Diseases are mention'd in antiquity, which are almost unknown to modern medicine; and new diseases have arisen, and propagated themselves, of which, there are no traces in antient history. And in this particular we may observe, upon comparison, that the disadvantage is very much on the side of the moderns. Not to mention some others of less importance, the small pox commits such ravages, as would almost alone account for the great superiority suppos'd in antient times. The tenth or the twelfth part of mankind, destroy'd every generation, should make a vast difference, it may be thought, in the numbers of the people; and when join'd to venereal distempers, a new plague diffus'd every where, this disease is perhaps equivalent, by its constant operation, to the three great scourges of mankind, war, pestilence, and famine. Were it certain, therefore, that antient times were more populous than the present, and could no moral causes be assign'd for so great a change; these physical causes alone, in the opinion of many, would be sufficient to give us satisfaction on that head.

BUT is it certain, that antiquity was so much more populous, as is pretended? The extravagancies of _Vossius_, with regard to this subject, are well known. But an author of much greater genius and discernment has ventur'd to affirm, that, according to the best computations which these subjects will admit of, there are not now, on the face of the earth, the fiftieth part of mankind, which existed in the time of _Julius Caesar_[n3]. It may easily be observ'd, that the comparisons, in this case, must be very imperfect, even tho' we confine ourselves to the scene of antient history; _Europe_, and the nations about the _Mediterranean_. We know not exactly the numbers of any _European_ kingdom, or even city, at present: How can we pretend to calculate those of antient cities and states, where historians have left us such imperfect traces? For my part, the matter appears to me so uncertain, that, as I intend to throw together some reflections on that head, I shall intermingle the inquiry concerning _causes_ with that concerning _facts_; which ought never to be admitted, where the facts can be ascertain'd with any tolerable assurance. We shall, _first_, consider, whether it be probable, from what we know of the situation of society in both periods, that antiquity must have been more populous; _secondly_, whether in reality it was so. If I can make appear, that the conclusion is not so certain as is pretended, in favour of antiquity, 'tis all I aspire to.

IN general, we may observe, that the question with regard to the comparative populousness of ages or kingdoms implies very important consequences, and commonly determines concerning the preference of their whole police, manners, and constitution of government. For as there is in all men, both male and female, a desire and power of generation, more active than is ever universally exerted, the restraints which they lie under, must proceed from some difficulties in mens situation, which it belongs to a wise legislature carefully to observe and remove. Almost every man who thinks he can maintain a family, will have one; and the human species, at this rate of propagation, would more than double every generation, were every one coupled as soon as he comes to the age of puberty. How fast do mankind multiply in every colony or new settlement; where it is an easy matter to provide for a family; and where men are no way straitened or confined, as in long establish'd governments? History tells us frequently of plagues, which have swept away the third or fourth part of a people: Yet in a generation or two, the destruction was not perceiv'd; and the society had again acquir'd their former number. The lands which were cultivated, the houses built, the commodities rais'd, the riches acquir'd, enabled the people who escap'd, immediately to marry, and to rear families, which supply'd the place of those who had perish'd[n4]. And for a like reason, every wise, just, and mild government, by rendering the condition of its subjects easy and secure, will always abound most in people, as well as in commodities and riches. A country, indeed, whose climate and soil are fitted for vines, will naturally be more populous than one which produces only corn, and that more populous than one which is only fitted for pasturage. But if every thing else be equal, it seems natural to expect, that where ever there are most happiness and virtue, and the wisest institutions, there will also be most people.

THE question, therefore, concerning the populousness of antient and modern times, being allow'd of great importance, 'twill be requisite, if we would bring it to some determination, to compare both the _domestic_ and _political_ situation of these two periods, in order to judge of the facts by their moral causes; which is the _first_ view in which we propos'd to consider them.

THE chief difference betwixt the _domestic_ oeconomy of the antients and that of the moderns consists in the practice of slavery, which prevail'd amongst the former, and which has been abolish'd for some centuries throughout the greatest part of _Europe_. Some passionate admirers of the antients, and zealous partisans of civil liberty, (for these sentiments, as they are both of them, in the main, extremely just, are also found to be almost inseparable), cannot forbear regretting the loss of this institution; and whilst they brand all submission to the government of a single person with the harsh denomination of slavery, they would gladly subject the greatest part of mankind to real slavery and subjection. But to one who considers coolly of the subject, it will appear, that human nature, in general, really enjoys more liberty at present, in the most arbitrary government of _Europe_, than it ever did during the most flourishing period of antient times. As much as submission to a petty prince, whose dominions extend not beyond a single city, is more grievous than obedience to a great monarch; so much is domestic slavery more cruel and oppressive than any civil subjection whatsoever. The more the master is remov'd from us in place and rank, the greater liberty we enjoy; the less are our actions inspected and controul'd; and the fainter that cruel comparison becomes betwixt our own subjection, and the freedom, and even dominion of another. The remains that are found of domestic slavery, in the _American_ colonies, and amongst some _European_ nations, would never surely create a desire of rendering it more universal. The little humanity commonly observ'd in persons accustom'd, from their infancy, to exercise so great authority over their fellow creatures, and to trample upon human nature, were sufficient alone to disgust us with that authority. Nor can a more probable reason be given for the severe, I might say, barbarous, manners of antient times, than the practice of domestic slavery; by which every man of rank was render'd a petty tyrant, and educated amidst the flattery, submission, and low debasement of his slaves.

ACCORDING to the antient practice, all checks were on the inferior, to restrain him to the duty of submission; none on the superior, to engage him to the reciprocal duties of gentleness and humanity. In modern times, a bad servant finds not easily a good master, nor a bad master a good servant; and the checks are mutual, suitable to the inviolable and eternal laws of reason and equity.

THE custom of exposing old, useless, or sick slaves in an island of the _Tyber_, there to starve, seems to have been pretty common in _Rome_; and whoever recover'd, after having been so expos'd, had his liberty given him, by an edict of the Emperor _Claudius_; where it was likewise forbid to kill any slave, merely for old age or sickness[n5]. But supposing that this edict was strictly obey'd, would it better the domestic treatment of slaves, or render their lives much more comfortable? We may imagine what others would practise, when it was the profess'd maxim of the elder _Cato_, to sell his superannuated slaves for any price, rather than maintain what he esteem'd an useless burthen[n6].

The _ergastula_, or dungeons, where slaves in chains were beat to work, were very common all over _Italy_. _Columella_[n7] advises, that they be always built under ground; and recommends[n8] it as the duty of a careful overseer, to call over every day the names of these slaves, like the mustering of a regiment or ship's company, in order to know presently when any of them had deserted. A proof of the frequency of these _ergastula_, and of the great number of slaves confin'd in them.

A CHAIN'D slave for a porter was usual in _Rome_, as appears from _Ovid_[n9], and other authors[n10]. Had not these people shaken off all sense of compassion towards that unhappy part of their species, would they have presented all their friends, at the first entrance, with such an image of the severity of the master, and misery of the slave?

NOTHING so common in all trials, even of civil causes, as to call for the evidence of slaves; which was always extorted by the most exquisite torments. _Demosthenes_ says[n11], that where it was possible to produce, for the same fact, either freemen or slaves as witnesses, the judges always preferr'd the torturing of slaves, as a more certain and infallible evidence[n12]. SENECA draws a picture of that disorderly luxury, which changes day into night, and night into day, and inverts every stated hour of every office in life. Amongst other circumstances, such as displacing the meals and time of bathing, he mentions, that, regularly, about the third hour of the night, the neighbours of one who indulges this false refinement, hear the noise of whips and lashes; and, upon inquiry, find he is then taking an account of the conduct of his servants, and giving them due correction and discipline. This is not remark'd as an instance of cruelty, but only of disorder, which, even in actions the most usual and methodical, changes the fix'd hours that an establish'd custom had assign'd them[n13].

BUT our present business is only to consider the influence of slavery on the populousness of a state. 'Tis pretended, that, in this particular, the antient practice had infinitely the advantage, and was the chief cause of that extreme populousness which is suppos'd in those times. At present, all masters discourage the marrying of their male servants, and admit not by any means the marriage of the female, who are then suppos'd altogether incapacitated for their service. But where the property of the servants is lodg'd in the master, their marriage and fertility form his riches, and bring him a succession of slaves, that supply the place of those whom age and infirmity have disabled. He encourages, therefore, their propagation as much as that of his cattle; rears the young with the same care; and educates them to some art or calling, which may render them more useful or valuable to him. The opulent are, by this policy, interested in the being at least, tho' not the well-being of the poor; and enrich themselves, by increasing the number and industry of those who are subjected to them. Each man, being a sovereign in his own family, has the same interest with regard to it, as the prince with regard to the state; and has not, like the prince, any opposite motives of ambition or vain-glory, which may lead him to depopulate his little sovereignty. All of it is, at all times, under his eye; and he has leisure to inspect the most minute detail of the marriage and education of his subjects.[n14] Such are the consequences of domestic slavery, according to the first aspect and appearance of things: But if we enter more deeply into the subject, we shall perhaps find reason to retract our hasty determinations. The comparison is shocking betwixt the management of human creatures and that of cattle; but being extremely just, when apply'd to the present subject, it may be proper to trace the consequences of it. At the capital, near all great cities, in all populous, rich, industrious provinces, few cattle are bred. Provisions, lodging, attendance, labour, are there dear; and men find better their account in buying the cattle, after they come to a certain age, from the remoter and cheaper countries. These are consequently the only breeding countries for cattle; and, by a parity of reason, for men too, when the latter are put on the same footing with the former. To rear a child in _London_ till he could be serviceable, would cost much dearer, than to buy one of the same age from _Scotland_ or _Ireland_; where he had been rais'd in a cottage, cover'd with rags, and fed on oatmeal or potatoes. Those who had slaves, therefore, in all the richer and more populous countries, would discourage the pregnancy of the females, and either prevent or destroy the birth. The human species would perish in those places where it ought to increase the fastest; and a perpetual recruit be needed from all the poorer and more desart provinces. Such a continu'd drain would tend mightily to depopulate the state, and render great cities ten times more destructive than with us; where every man is master of himself, and provides for his children from the powerful instinct of nature, not the calculations of sordid interest. If _London_, at present, without much increasing, needs a yearly recruit from the country of 5000 people, as is commonly computed; what must it require, if the greatest part of the tradesmen and common people were slaves, and were hinder'd from breeding by their avaricious masters?

ALL antient authors tell us, that there was a perpetual flux of slaves to _Italy_ from the remoter provinces, particularly _Syria, Cilicia_[n15], _Cappadocia_, the Lesser _Asia, Thrace_, and _Egypt_: Yet the number of people increas'd not in _Italy_; and writers complain of the continual decay of industry and agriculture[n16]. Where then is that extreme fertility of the _Roman_ slaves, which is commonly suppos'd? So far from multiplying, they could not, it seems, so much as keep up the stock, without immense recruits. And tho' great numbers were continually manumitted, and converted into _Roman_ citizens, the numbers even of these did not increase[n17], till the freedom of the city was communicated to foreign provinces.

THE term for a slave born and bred in the family, was _verna_[n18]; and these slaves seem to have been intitled by custom to privileges and indulgences beyond others; a sufficient reason why the masters would not be fond of rearing many of that kind[n19]. Whoever is acquainted with the maxims of our planters, will acknowledge the justness of this observation[n20].

ATTICUS is much prais'd by his historian for the care which he took in recruiting his family from the slaves born in it[n21]: May we not thence infer, that that practice was not then very common?

THE names of slaves in the _Greek_ comedies, _Syrus, Mysus, Geta, Thrax, Davus, Lydus, Phryx, &c_. afford a presumption, that at _Athens_, at least, most of the slaves were imported from foreign nations. The _Athenians_, says _Strabo_[n22], gave to their slaves, either the names of the nations whence they were bought, as _Lydus, Syrus_; or the names that were most common amongst those nations, as _Manes_ or _Midas_ to a _Phrygian, Tybias_, to a _Paphlagonian_.[n22]

DEMOSTHENES, after having mention'd a law which forbid any man to strike the slave of another, praises the humanity of this law; and adds, that if the barbarians from whom slaves were bought, had information that their countrymen met with such gentle treatment, they would entertain a great esteem for the _Athenians_[n23]. _Isocrates_[n24] too insinuates, that the slaves of the _Greeks_ were generally or very commonly barbarians.

'Tis well known, that _Demosthenes_, in his nonage, had been defrauded of a large fortune by his tutors, and that afterwards he recover'd, by a prosecution at law, the value of his patrimony. His orations, on that occasion, still remain, and contain a very exact detail of the whole substance left by his father[n25], in money, merchandise, houses, and slaves, along with the value of each particular. Amongst the rest were 52 slaves, handicraftsmen, _viz_. 32 sword-cutlers, and 20 cabinet-makers[n26]; all males; not a word of any wives, children, or family, which they certainly would have had, had it been a common custom at _Athens_ to breed from the slaves: And the value of the whole must have depended very much on that circumstance. No female slaves are even so much as mention'd, except some house-maids, who belong'd to his mother. This argument has great force, if it be not altogether decisive.

CONSIDER this passage of _Plutarch_[n27], speaking of the elder _Cato_. He had a great number of slaves, whom he took care to buy at the sales of prisoners of war; and he chose them young, that they might easily be accustom'd to any diet or manner of life, and be instructed in any business or labour, as men teach any thing to young dogs or horses. -----And esteeming love the chief source of all disorders, he allow'd the male slaves to have a commerce with the female in his family, upon paying a certain sum for this privilege: But he strictly forbid all intrigues out of his family. Are there any symptoms in this narration of that care which is suppos'd in the antients, of the marriage and propagation of their slaves? If that was a common practice, founded on general interest, it would surely have been embrac'd by _Cato_, who was a great oeconomist, and liv'd in times when the antient frugality and simplicity of manners were still in credit and reputation.

IT is expressly remark'd by the writers of the _Roman_ law, that scarce any ever purchase slaves with a view of breeding from them[n28].

152

OUR lackeys and house-maids, I own, do not serve much to multiply their species: But the antients, beside those who attended on their person, had all their labour perform'd by slaves, who liv'd, many of them, in their family; and some great men possess'd to the number of 10,000. If there be any suspicion, therefore, that this institution was unfavourable to propagation, (and the same reason, at least in part, holds with regard to antient slaves as well as modern servants), how destructive must slavery have prov'd?

HISTORY mentions a _Roman_ nobleman, who had 400 slaves under the same roof with him; and having been assassinated at home by the furious revenge of one of them, the law was executed with rigour, and all without exception were put to death[n29]. Many other _Roman_ noblemen had families equally, or more numerous; and I believe every one will allow, that this would scarce be practicable, were we to suppose all the slaves marry'd, and the females to be breeders[n30].

SO early as the poet _Hesiod_[n31], marry'd slaves, whether male or female, were esteem'd very inconvenient. How much more, where families had increas'd to such an enormous size, as in _Rome_, and the antient simplicity of manners was banish'd from all ranks of people?

XENOPHON in his oeconomics, where he gives directions for the management of a farm, recommends a strict care and attention of laying the male and the female slaves at a distance from each other. He seems not to suppose that they are ever marry'd. The only slaves amongst the _Greeks_ that appear to have continued their own breed, were the _Helotes_, who had houses apart, and were more the slaves of the public than of individuals[n32].

THE same author[n33] tells us, that _Nicias_'s overseer, by agreement with his master, was oblig'd to pay him an obolus a day for each slave; beside maintaining them, and keeping up the number. Had the antient slaves been all breeders, this last circumstance of the contract had been superfluous.

154

THE antients talk so frequently of a fix'd, stated portion of provisions assign'd to each slave[n34], that we are naturally led to conclude, that slaves liv'd almost all single, and receiv'd that portion as a kind of board-wages.

THE practice, indeed, of marrying the slaves seems not to have been very common, even amongst the country-labourers, where it is more naturally to be expected. _Cato_[n35], enumerating the slaves requisite to labour a vineyard of a hundred acres, makes them amount to 15; the overseer and his wife, _villicus_ and _villica_, and 13 male slaves; for an olive-plantation of 240 acres, the overseer and his wife, and 11 male slaves; and so in proportion to a greater or less plantation or vineyard.

VARRO[n36], citing this passage of _Cato_, allows his computation to be just in every respect, except the last. For as it is requisite, says he, to have an overseer and his wife, whether the vineyard or plantation be great or small, this must alter the exactness of the proportion. Had _Cato_'s computation been erroneous in any other respect, it had certainly been corrected by _Varro_, who seems fond of discovering so trivial an error.

THE same author[n37], as well as _Columella_[n38], recommends it as requisite to give a wife to the overseer, in order to attach him the more strongly to his master's service. This was, therefore, a peculiar indulgence granted to a slave, in whom so great a confidence was repos'd.

IN the same place, _Varro_ mentions it as an useful precaution, not to buy too many slaves from the same nation; lest they beget factions and seditions in the family: A presumption, that in _Italy_ the greatest part, even of the country labouring slaves, (for he speaks of no other), were bought from the remoter provinces. All the world knows, that the family slaves in _Rome_, who were instruments of show and luxury, were commonly imported from the east. _Hoc profecere_, says PLINY, speaking of the jealous care of masters, _mancipiorum legiones, et in domo turba externa ac servorum quoque causa nomenclator adhibendus_[n39].

IT is indeed recommended by _Varro_[n40], to propagate young shepherds in the family from the old ones. For as grasing farms were commonly in remote and cheap places, and each shepherd liv'd in a cottage apart, his marriage and increase were not liable to the same inconveniencies as in dearer places, and where many servants liv'd in a family; which was universally the case in such of the _Roman_ farms as produc'd wine or corn. If we consider this exception with regard to the shepherds, and weigh the reason of it, it will serve for a strong confirmation of all our foregoing suspicions[n41]. COLUMELLA[n42], I own, advises the master to give a reward, and even liberty to a female slave, that had rear'd him above three children: A proof, that sometimes the antients propagated from their slaves; which, indeed, cannot be deny'd. Were it otherwise, the practice of slavery, being so common in antiquity, must have been destructive to a degree which no expedient could repair. All I pretend to infer from these reasonings, is, that slavery is in general disadvantageous both to the happiness and populousness of mankind, and that its place is much better supply'd by the practice of hir'd servants.

THE laws, or, as some writers call them, the seditions of the _Gracchi_, were occasion'd by their observing the increase of slaves all over _Italy_, and the diminution of free citizens. _Appian_[n43] ascribes this increase to the propagation of the slaves; _Plutarch_[n44] to the purchase of barbarians, who were chain'd, and imprison'd, $$[greek text]$$[n45]. 'Tis to be presum'd, that both causes concurr'd. SICILY, says _Florus_[n46], was full of _ergastula_, and was cultivated by labourers in chains. _Eunus_ and _Athenio_ excited the servile war, by breaking up these monstrous prisons, and giving liberty to 60,000 slaves. The younger _Pompey_ augmented his army in _Spain_ by the same expedient[n47]. If the country labourers, throughout the _Roman_ empire, were so generally in this situation, and if it was difficult or impossible to find separate lodgings for the families of the city-servants, how unfavourable to propagation, as well as humanity, must the institution of domestic slavery be esteem'd?

CONSTANTINOPLE, at present, requires the same recruits of slaves from all the provinces, which _Rome_ did of old; and these provinces are of consequence far from being populous.

AEGYPT, according to Mons. _Maillet_, sends continual colonies of black slaves to the other parts of the _Turkish_ empire; and receives annually an equal return of white: the one brought from the inland parts of _Africa_; the other from _Mingrelia_, _Circassia_, and _Tartary_.

OUR modern convents are, no doubt, very bad institutions: But there is reason to suspect, that antiently every great family in _Italy_, and probably in other parts of the world, was a species of convent. And tho' we have reason to detest all those Popish institutions, as nurseries of the most abject superstition, burthensome to the public, and oppressive to the poor prisoners, male as well as female; yet may it be question'd whether they be so destructive to the populousness of a state as is commonly imagin'd. Were the land which belongs to a convent, bestow'd on a nobleman, he would spend its revenue on dogs, horses, grooms, footmen, cooks, and house-maids; and his family would not furnish many more citizens than the convent.

THE common reason why parents thrust their daughters into nunneries, is, that they may not be overburthen'd with too numerous a family; but the antients had a method almost as innocent, and more effectual to that purpose, _viz_. the exposing their children in the earliest infancy. This practice was very common; and is not mention'd by any author of those times with the horror it deserves, or scarce[n48] even with disapprobation. _Plutarch_, the humane, good-natur'd _Plutarch_[n49], recommends it as a virtue in _Attalus_, King of _Pergamus_, that he murder'd, or, if you will, expos'd all his own children, in order to leave his crown to the son of his brother, _Eumenes_; signalizing in this manner his gratitude and affection to _Eumenes_, who had left him his heir preferable to that son. 'Twas _Solon_, the most celebrated of the sages of _Greece_, who gave parents permission by law to kill their children[n50].

SHALL we then allow these two circumstances to compensate each other, _viz_. monastic vows and the exposing of children, and to be unfavourable, in equal degrees, to the propagation of mankind? I doubt the advantage is here on the side of antiquity. Perhaps, by an odd connection of causes, the barbarous practice of the antients might rather render those times more populous. By removing the terrors of too numerous a family, it would engage many people in marriage; and such is the force of natural affection, that very few, in comparison, would have resolution enough, when it came to the push, to carry into execution their former intentions.

CHINA, the only country where this barbarous practice of exposing children prevails at present, is the most populous country we know; and every man is marry'd before he is twenty. Such early marriages could scarce be general, had not men the prospect of so easy a method of getting rid of their children. I own, that _Plutarch_[n51] speaks of it as a very universal maxim of the poor to expose their children; and as the rich were then averse to marriage, on account of the courtship they met with from those who expected legacies from them, the public must have been in a bad situation betwixt them[n52]. OF all sciences there is none, where first appearances are more deceitful than in politics. Hospitals for foundlings seem favourable to the increase of numbers; and, perhaps, may be so, when kept under proper restrictions. But when they open the door to every one, without distinction, they have probably a contrary effect, and are pernicious to the state. 'Tis computed, that every ninth child born at _Paris_, is sent to the hospital; tho' it seems certain, according to the common course of human affairs, that 'tis not a hundredth part whose parents are altogether incapacitated to rear and educate them. The infinite difference, for health, industry, and morals, betwixt an education in an hospital and that in a private family, should induce us not to make the entrance into an hospital too easy and engaging. To kill one's own child is shocking to nature, and must therefore be pretty unusual; but to turn over the care of him upon others is very tempting to the natural indolence of mankind.

HAVING consider'd the domestic life and manners of the antients, compar'd to those of the moderns; where, in the main, we seem rather superior, so far as the present question is concern'd; we shall now examine the _political_ customs and institutions of both ages, and weigh their influence in retarding or forwarding the propagation of mankind.

BEFORE the increase of the _Roman_ power, or rather till its full establishment, almost all the nations which are the scene of antient history, were divided into small territories or petty commonwealths; where of course a great equality of fortune prevail'd and the center of the government was always very near its frontiers. This was the situation of affairs, not only in _Greece_ and _Italy_, but also in _Spain, Gaul, Germany, Afric_, and a great part of the Lesser _Asia_. And it must be own'd, that no institution could be more favourable to the propagation of mankind. For tho' a man of an overgrown fortune, not being able to consume more than another, must share it with those who serve and attend him; yet their possession being precarious, they have not the same encouragement to marriage, as if each had a small fortune, secure and independent. Enormous cities are, besides, destructive to society, beget vice and disorder of all kinds, starve the remoter provinces, and even starve themselves, by the high prices to which they raise all provisions. Where each man had his little house and field to himself, and each county had its capital, free and indedendent; what a happy situation of mankind! How favourable to industry and agriculture; to marriage and propagation! The prolific virtue of men, were it to act in its full extent, without that restraint which poverty and necessity imposes on it, would double the numbers every generation: And nothing surely can give it more liberty, than such small commonwealths, and such an equality of fortune amongst the citizens. All small states naturally produce equality of fortune, because they afford no opportunities of great increase; but small commonwealths much more, by that division of power and authority which is essential to them.

WHEN _Xenophon_[n53] return'd after the famous expedition with _Cyrus_, he hir'd himself and 6000 of the _Greeks_ into the service of _Seuthes_, a prince of _Thrace_; and the articles of his agreement were, that each soldier should receive a _daric_ a-month, each captain two _darics_, and he himself, as general, four: A regulation of pay which would not a little surprise our modern officers.

DEMOSTHENES and AEschines, with eight more, were sent ambassadors to _Philip_ of _Macedon_, and their appointments for above four months were a thousand _drachmas_, which is less than a _drachma_ a-day for each ambassador[n54]. But a _drachma_ a-day, nay sometimes two[n55], was the pay of a common foot-soldier.

A CENTURION amongst the _Romans_ had only double pay to a private man, in _Polybius_'s[n56] time; and we accordingly find the gratuities after a triumph regulated by that proportion[n57]. But _Mark Anthony_ and the triumvirate gave the centurions five times the reward of the other[n58]. So much had the increase of the commonwealth increas'd the inequality amongst the citizens[n59].

IT must be own'd, that the situation of affairs in modern times, with regard to civil liberty, as well as equality of fortune, is not near so favourable, either to the propagation or happiness of mankind. _Europe_ is shar'd out mostly into great monarchies; and such parts of it as are divided into small territories, are commonly govern'd by absolute princes, who ruin their people by a ridiculous mimickry of the greater monarchs, in the splendor of their court and number of their forces. _Swisserland_ alone and _Holland_ resemble the antient republics; and tho' the former is far from possessing any advantage either of soil, climate, or commerce, yet the numbers of people, with which it abounds, notwithstanding their inlisting themselves into every service in _Europe_, prove sufficiently the advantages of their political institutions.

THE antient republics deriv'd their chief or only security from the numbers of their citizens. The _Trachinians_ having lost great numbers of their people, the remainder, instead of enriching themselves by the inheritance of their fellow-citizens, apply'd to _Sparta_, their metropolis, for a new stock of inhabitants. The _Spartans_ immediately collected ten thousand men; amongst whom the old citizens divided the lands of which the former proprietors had perish'd[n60].

AFTER _Timoleon_ had banish'd _Dionysius_ from _Syracuse_, and had settled the affairs of _Sicily_, finding the cities of _Syracuse_ and _Sellinuntium_ extremely depopulated by tyranny, war, and faction, he invited over from _Greece_ some new inhabitants to repeople them[n61]. Immediately forty thousand men (Plutarch[n62] says sixty thousand) offer'd themselves; and he distributed so many lots of land amongst them, to the great satisfaction of the antient inhabitants: a proof at once of the maxims of antient policy, which affected populousness more than riches; and of the good effects of these maxims, in the extreme populousness of that small country, _Greece_, which could at once supply so large a colony. The case was not much different with the _Romans_ in early times. He is a pernicious citizen, said _M. Curius_, who cannot be contented with seven acres[n63]. Such ideas of equality could not fail of producing great numbers of people. WE must now consider what disadvantages the antients lay under with regard to populousness, and what checks they receiv'd from their political maxims and institutions. There are commonly compensations in every human condition; and tho' these compensations be not always perfectly equivalent, yet they serve, at least, to restrain the prevailing principle. To compare them and estimate their influence is indeed very difficult, even where they take place in the same age and in neighboring countries: but where several ages have interven'd, and only scatter'd lights are afforded us by antient authors; what can we do but amuse ourselves by talking, _pro_ and _con_, on an interesting subject, and thereby correcting all hasty and violent determinations?

_First_, WE may observe, that the antient republics were almost in perpetual war; a natural effect of their martial spirit, their love of liberty, their mutual emulation, and that hatred which generally prevails amongst nations that live in a close neighbourhood. Now, war in a small state is much more destructive than in a great one; both because all the inhabitants, in the former case, must serve in the armies; and because the state is all frontier, and all expos'd to the inroads of the enemy.

THE maxims of antient war were much more destructive than those of modern; chiefly by the distribution of plunder, in which the soldiers were indulg'd. The private men in our armies are such a low rascally set of people, that we find any abundance beyond their simple pay, breeds confusion and disorder, and a total dissolution of discipline. The very wretchedness and meanness of those who fill the modern armies, render them less destructive to the countries which they invade: One instance, amongst many, of the deceitfulness of first appearances in all political reasonings[n64].

ANTIENT battles were much more bloody by the very nature of the weapons employ'd in them. The antients drew up their men 16 or 20, sometimes 50 men deep, which made a narrow front; and 'twas not difficult to find a field, in which both armies might be marshall'd, and might engage with each other. Even where any body of the troops was kept off by hedges, hillocks, woods, or hollow ways, the battle was not so soon decided betwixt the contending parties, but that the others had time to overcome the difficulties which oppos'd them, and take part in the engagement. And as the whole armies were thus engag'd, and each man closely buckl'd to his antagonist, the battles were commonly very bloody, and great slaughter made on both sides, but especially on the vanquish'd. The long, thin lines, requir'd by fire-arms, and the quick decision of the fray, render our modern engagements but partial rencounters, and enable the general, who is foil'd in the beginning of the day, to draw off the greatest part of his army, sound and entire. Could _Folard_'s project of the column take place, (which seems impracticable[n65]), it would render modern battles as destructive as the antient.

THE battles of antiquity, both by their duration, and their resemblance of single combats, were wrought up to a degree of fury quite unknown to latter ages. Nothing could then engage the combatants to give quarter, but the hopes of profit, by making slaves of their prisoners. In civil wars, as we learn from _Tacitus_[n66], the battles were the most bloody, because the prisoners were not slaves.

WHAT a stout resistance must be made, where the vanquish'd expected so hard a fate! How inveterate the rage, where the maxims of war were, in every respect, so bloody and severe!

INSTANCES are very frequent, in antient history, of cities besieg'd, whose inhabitants, rather than open their gates, murder'd their wives and children, and rush'd themselves on a voluntary death, sweeten'd perhaps with a little prospect of revenge upon the enemy. _Greeks_[n67], as well as _Barbarians_, have been often wrought up to this degree of fury. And the same determin'd spirit and cruelty must, in many other instances, less remarkable, have been extremely destructive to human society, in those petty commonwealths, which liv'd in a close neighbourhood, and were engag'd in perpetual wars and contentions.

SOMETIMES the wars in _Greece_, says _Plutarch_[n68], were carried on entirely by inroads, and robberies, and piracies. Such a method of war must be more destructive, in small states, than the bloodiest battles and sieges.

BY the laws of the twelve tables, possession for two years form'd a prescription for land; one year for moveables[n69]: An indication, that there was not in _Italy_, during that period, much more order, tranquillity, and settled police, than there is at present amongst the _Tartars_.

THE only cartel I remember in antient history, is that betwixt _Demetrius Poliorcetes_ and the _Rhodians_; when it was agreed, that a free citizen should be restor'd for 1000 _drachmas_, a slave bearing arms for 500[n70].

BUT, _secondly_, it appears, that antient manners were more unfavourable than the modern, not only in times of war, but also in those of peace; and that too in every respect, except the love of civil liberty and equality, which is, I own, of considerable importance. To exclude faction from a free government, is very difficult, if not altogether impracticable; but such inveterate rage betwixt the factions, and such bloody maxims, are found, in modern times, amongst religious parties alone, where bigotted priests are the accusers, judges, and executioners. In antient history, we may always observe, where one party prevail'd, whether the nobles or people, (for I can observe no difference in this respect[n71]), that they immediately butcher'd all of the opposite party who fell into their hands, and banish'd such as had been so fortunate as to escape their fury. No form of process, no law, no trial, no pardon. A fourth, a third, perhaps near a half of the city, were slaughter'd, or expell'd, every revolution; and the exiles always join'd foreign enemies, and did all the mischief possible to their fellow-citizens; till Fortune put it in their power to take full revenge by a new revolution. And as these were very frequent in such violent governments, the disorder, diffidence, jealousy, enmity, which must prevail, are not easy for us to imagine in this age of the world.

THERE are only two revolutions I can recollect in antient history, which pass'd without great severity, and great effusion of blood in massacres and assassinations, _viz_. the restoration of the _Athenian_ Democracy by _Thrasybulus_, and the subduing the _Roman_ republic by _Caesar_. We learn from antient history, that _Thrasybulus_ pass'd a general amnesty for all past offences; and first introduc'd that word, as well as practice, into _Greece_[n72]. It appears, however, from many orations of _Lysias_[n73], that the chief, and even some of the subaltern offenders, in the preceding tyranny, were try'd, and capitally punish'd. This is a difficulty not clear'd up, and even not observ'd, by antiquarians and historians. And as to _Caesar_'s clemency, tho' much celebrated, it would not gain great applause in the present age. He butcher'd, for instance, all _Cato_'s senate, when he became master of _Utica_[n74]; and these, we may readily believe, were not the most worthless of the party. All those who had borne arms against that usurper, were forfeited; and, by _Hirtius_'s law, declar'd incapable of all public offices.

THESE people were extremely fond of liberty; but seem not to have understood it very well. When the thirty tyrants first establish'd their dominion at _Athens_, they began with seizing all the sycophants and informers, who had been so troublesome during the Democracy, and putting them to death, by an arbitrary sentence and execution. _Every man_, say _Sallust_[n75] and _Lysias_[n76], _was rejoic'd at these punishments_; not considering, that liberty was from that moment annihilated.

THE utmost energy of the nervous style of _Thucydides_, and the great copiousness and expression of the _Greek_ language, seem to sink under that historian, when he attempts to describe the disorders which arose from faction, throughout all the _Greek_ commonwealths. You would imagine, that he still labours with a thought greater than he can find words to communicate. And he concludes his pathetic description with an observation, which is at once very refin'd and very solid. "In these contests," says he, "those who were dullest and most stupid, and had the least foresight, commonly prevail'd. For being conscious of this weakness, and dreading to be overreach'd by those of greater penetration, they went to work hastily, without premeditation, by the sword and poniard, and thereby prevented their antagonists, who were forming fine schemes and projects for their destruction[n77]." NOT to mention _Dionysius_[n78] the elder, who is computed to have butcher'd in cold blood above 10,000 of his fellow-citizens; not _Agathocles_[n79], Nabis[n80], and others, still more bloody than he; the transactions, even in free governments, were extremely violent and destructive. At _Athens_, the thirty tyrants and the nobles, in a twelvemonth, murder'd, without trial, about 1200 of the people, and banish'd above the half of the citizens that remain'd[n81]. In _Argos_, near the same time, the people kill'd 1200 of the nobles; and afterwards their own demagogues, because they had refus'd to carry their prosecutions farther[n82]. The people also in _Corcyra_ kill'd 1500 of the nobles, and banish'd a thousand[n83]. These numbers will appear the more surprising, if we consider the extreme smallness of these states. But all antient history is full of such instances[n84]. WHEN _Alexander_ order'd all the exiles to be restor'd, thro' all the cities; it was found that the whole amounted to 20,000 men[n85]; the remains probably of still greater slaughters and massacres. What an astonishing multitude in so narrow a country as antient _Greece_! And what domestic confusion, jealousy, partiality, revenge, heartburnings, must tear those cities, where factions were wrought up to such a degree of fury and despair! 'TWOULD be easier, says _Isocrates_ to _Philip_, to raise an army in _Greece_ at present from the vagabonds than from the cities.

EVEN where affairs came not to such extremities, (which they fail'd not to do almost in every city twice or thrice every century), property was render'd very precarious by the maxims of antient government. _Xenophon_, in the banquet of _Socrates_, gives us a very natural, unaffected description of the tyranny of the _Athenian_ people. "In my poverty," says _Charmides_, "I am much more happy than ever I was during my riches; as much as it is happier to be in security than in terrors, free than a slave, to receive than to pay court, to be trusted than suspected. Formerly I was oblig'd to caress every informer; some imposition was continually laid upon me; and it was never allow'd me to travel, or be absent from the city. At present, when I am poor, I look big, and threaten others. The rich are afraid of me, and show me every kind of civility and respect; and I am become a kind of tyrant in the city[n86]."

IN one of the pleadings of _Lysias_[n87], the orator very coolly speaks of it, by the by, as a maxim of the _Athenian_ people, That whenever they wanted money, they put to death some of the rich citizens as well as strangers, for the sake of the forfeiture. In mentioning this, he seems to have no intention of blaming them; still less of provoking them who were his audience and judges. WHETHER a man was a citizen or a stranger amongst that people, it seems indeed requisite, either that he should impoverish himself, or the people would impoverish him, and perhaps kill him into the bargain. The orator last mention'd gives a pleasant account of an estate laid out in the public service[n88]; that is, above the third of it, in rareeshows and figur'd dances.

I NEED not insist on the _Greek_ tyrannies, which were altogether horrible. Even the mix'd monarchies, by which most of the antient states of _Greece_ were govern'd, before the introduction of republics, were very unsettled. Scarce any city, but _Athens_, says _Isocrates_, could show a succession of kings for four or five generations[n89].

BESIDES many other obvious reasons for the instability of antient monarchies, the equal division of property amongst the brothers in private families, by a necessary consequence, must contribute to unsettle and disturb the state. The universal preference given to the elder in modern governments, though it increases the inequality of fortunes, has, however, this good effect, that it accustoms men to the same idea of public succession, and cuts off all claim and pretension of the younger.

THE new settled colony of _Heraclea_, falling immediately into factions, apply'd to _Sparta_, who sent _Heripidas_ with full authority to quiet their dissensions. This man, not provok'd by any opposition, not inflam'd by party-rage, knew no better expedient than immediately putting to death about 500 of the citizens[n90]. A strong proof how deeply rooted these violent maxims of government were throughout all _Greece_.

IF such was the disposition of mens minds amongst that refin'd people, what may be expected in the commonwealths of _Italy, Afric, Spain_, and _Gaul_, which were denominated barbarous? Why otherwise did the _Greeks_ so much value themselves on their humanity, gentleness, and moderation, above all other nations? This reasoning seems very natural. But unluckily the history of the _Roman_ commonwealth, in its earlier times, if we give credit to the receiv'd accounts, stands against us. No blood was ever shed in any sedition at _Rome_, till the murder of the _Gracchi. Dionysius Halicarnassaeus_[n91], observing the singular humanity of the _Roman_ people in this respect, makes use of it as an argument that they were originally of _Grecian_ extraction: Whence we may conclude, that the factions and revolutions in the barbarous republics were more violent than even those of _Greece_ above mention'd.

IF the _Romans_ were so late in coming to blows, they made ample compensation after they had once enter'd upon the bloody scene; and _Appian_'s history of their civil wars contains the most frightful picture of massacres, proscriptions, and forfeitures, that ever was presented to the world. What pleases most in that historian, is, that he seems to feel a proper resentment of these barbarous proceedings; and talks not with that provoking coolness and indifference, which custom had produc'd in many of the _Greek_ historians[n92]. THE maxims of antient politics contain, in general, so little humanity and moderation, that it seems superfluous to give any particular reason for the violences committed at any particular period. Yet I cannot forbear observing, that the laws, in the latter ages of the _Roman_ commonwealth, were so absurdly contriv'd, that they oblig'd the heads of parties to have recourse to these extremities. All capital punishments were abolish'd: However criminal, or, what is more, however dangerous, any citizen might be, he could not regularly be punish'd otherwise than by banishment: And it became necessary, in the revolutions of party, to draw the sword of private vengeance; nor was it easy, when laws were once violated, to set bounds to these sanguinary proceedings. Had _Brutus_ himself prevail'd over the _triumvirate_, could he, in common prudence, have allow'd _Octavius_ and _Anthony_ to live, and have contented himself with banishing them to _Rhodes_ or _Marseilles_, where they might still have plotted new commotions and rebellions? His executing C. _Antonius_, brother to the _triumvir_, shows evidently his sense of the matter. Did not _Cicero_, with the approbation of all the wise and virtuous of _Rome_, arbitrarily put to death _Catiline_'s associates, contrary to law, and without any trial or form of process? And if he moderated his executions, did it not proceed, either from the clemency of his temper, or the conjunctures of the times? A wretched security in a government which pretends to laws and liberty.

THUS, one extreme produces another. In the same manner as excessive severity in the laws is apt to beget great relaxation in their execution; so their excessive lenity naturally engenders cruelty and barbarity. 'Tis dangerous to force us,in any case, to transgress their sacred boundaries.

ONE general cause of the disorders so frequent in all antient governments, seems to have consisted in the great difficulty of establishing any Aristocracy in those ages, and the perpetual discontents and seditions of the people, whenever even the meanest and most beggarly were excluded from the legislature, and from public offices. The very quality of _freeman_ gave such a rank, being oppos'd to that of _slave_, that it seem'd to intitle the possessor to every power and privilege of the commonwealth. _Solon_'s[n93] laws excluded no freeman from votes or elections, but confin'd some magistracies to a particular _census_; yet were the people never satisfied till those laws were repeal'd. By the treaty with _Antipater_[n94], no _Athenian_ had a vote, whose _census_ was less than 2000 _drachmas_, (about 60l. _Sterling_). And tho' such a government would to us appear sufficiently democratical, it was so disagreeable to that people, that above two thirds immediately deserted their country[n95]. _Cassander_ reduc'd that _census_ to the half[n96]; yet still the government was consider'd as an oligarchical tyranny, and the effect of foreign violence.

SERVIUS TULLIUS's[n97] laws seem very equal and reasonable, by fixing the power in proportion to the property: Yet the _Roman_ people could never be brought quietly to submit to them.

IN those days, there was no medium betwixt a severe, jealous Aristocracy, over discontented subjects; and a turbulent, factious, tyrannical Democracy.

BUT, _thirdly_, there are many other circumstances, in which antient nations seem inferior to the modern, both for the happiness and increase of mankind. Trade, manufactures, industry, were no where, in former ages, so flourishing as they are at present in _Europe_. The only garb of the antients, both for males and females, seems to have been a kind of flannel, which they wore commonly white or grey, and which they scour'd as often as it grew dirty. _Tyre_, which carry'd on, after _Carthage_, the greatest commerce of any city in the _Mediterranean_, before it was destroy'd by _Alexander_, was no mighty city, if we credit _Arrian_'s account of its inhabitants[n98]. _Athens_ is commonly suppos'd to have been a trading city: But it was as populous before the _Median_ war, as at any time after it, according to _Herodotus_[n99]; and yet its commerce, at that time, was so inconsiderable, that, as the same historian observes[n100], even the neighboring coasts of _Asia_ were as little frequented by the _Greeks_ as the pillars of _Hercules_: For beyond these he conceiv'd nothing.

GREAT interest of money, and great profits of trade, are an infallible indication, that industry and commerce are but in their infancy. We read in _Lysias_[n101] of 100 _per cent_. profit made on a cargo of two talents, sent to no greater distance than from _Athens_ to the _Adriatic_: Nor is this mention'd as an instance of exorbitant profit. _Antidorus_, says _Demosthenes_[n102], paid three talents and a half for a house, which he let at a talent a-year: And the orator blames his own tutors for not employing his money to like advantage. My fortune, says he, in eleven years minority, ought to have been tripled. The value of 20 of the slaves left by his father, he computes at 40 minas; and the yearly profit of their labour at 12[n103]. The most moderate interest at _Athens_, (for there was higher[n104] often paid), was 12 _per cent_.[n105], and that paid monthly. Not to insist upon the exorbitant interest of 34 _per cent_. to which the vast sums distributed in elections had rais'd money[n106] at _Rome_, we find, that _Verres_, before that factious period, stated 24 _per cent_. for money, which he left in the publicans hands. And tho' _Cicero_ exclaims against this article, it is not on account of the extravagant usury; but because it had never been customary to state any interest on such occasions[n107]. Interest, indeed, sunk at _Rome_, after the settlement of the empire: But it never remain'd any considerable time so low, as in the commercial states of modern ages[n108].

AMONGST the other inconveniencies which the _Athenians_ felt from the fortifying _Decelia_ by the _Lacedemonians_, it is represented by _Thucydides_[n109], as one of the most considerable, that they could not bring over their corn from _Euboea_ by land, passing by _Oropus_; but were oblig'd to imbark it, and to fail about the promontory of _Sunium_. A surprising instance of the imperfection of antient navigation: For the water-carriage is not here above double the land.

I DO not remember any passage in any antient author, where the growth of any city is ascrib'd to the establishment of a manufacture. The commerce which is said to flourish, is chiefly the exchange of those commodities for which different soils and climates were suited. The sale of wine and oil into _Africa_, according to _Diodorus Siculus_[n110], was the foundation of the riches of _Agrigentum_. The situation of the city of _Sybaris_, according to the same author[n111], was the cause of its immense populousness; being built near the two rivers _Crathys_ and _Sybaris_. But these two rivers, we may observe, are not navigable; and could only produce some fertile valleys, for agriculture and husbandry; an advantage so inconsiderable, that a modern writer would scarcely have taken notice of it.

THE barbarity of the antient tyrants, along with the extreme love of liberty, which animated those ages, must have banish'd every merchant and manufacturer, and have quite depopulated the state, had it subsisted upon industry and commerce. While the cruel and suspicious _Dionysius_ was carrying on his butcheries, who, that was not detain'd by his landed property, and could have carry'd along with him any art or skill to procure a subsistence in other countries, would have remain'd expos'd to such implacable barbarity? The persecutions of _Philip_ II. and _Lewis_ XIV. fill'd all _Europe_ with the manufacturers of _Flanders_, and of _France_.

I GRANT, that agriculture is the species of industry which is chiefly requisite to the subsistence of multitudes; and it is possible, that this industry may flourish, even where manufactures and other arts are unknown or neglected. _Swisserland_ is at present a very remarkable instance; where we find, at once, the most skilful husbandmen and the most bungling tradesmen, that are to be met with in all _Europe_. That agriculture flourish'd mightily in _Greece_ and _Italy_, at least in some parts of them, and at some periods, we have reason to presume: And whether the mechanical arts had reach'd the same degree of perfection, may not be esteem'd so material; especially, if we consider the great equality in the antient republics, where each family was oblig'd to cultivate, with the greatest care and industry, its own little field, in order to its subsistence.

BUT is it just reasoning, because agriculture may, in some instances, flourish without trade or manufactures, to conclude, that, in any great extent of country, and for any great tract of time, it would subsist alone? The most natural way, surely, of encouraging husbandry, is, first to excite other kinds of industry, and thereby afford the labourer a ready market for his commodities, and a return of such goods as may contribute to his pleasure and enjoyment. This method is infallible and universal; and as it prevails more in modern governments than in the antient, it affords a presumption of the superior populousness of the former.

EVERY man, says _Xenophon_[n112], may be a farmer: No art or skill is requisite: All consists in the industry, and attention to the execution. A strong proof, as _Columella_ hints, that agriculture was but little known in the age of _Xenophon_.

All our latter improvements and refinements, have they operated nothing towards the easy subsistence of men, and consequently towards their propagation and increase? Our superior skill in mechanics, the discovery of new worlds, by which commerce has been so much enlarg'd, the establishment of posts, and the use of bills of exchange; these seem all extremely useful to the encouragement of art, industry, and populousness. Were we to strike off these, what a check should we give to every kind of business and labour, and what multitudes of families would immediately perish from want and hunger? And it seems not probable, that we could supply the place of these new inventions by any other regulation or institution.

HAVE we reason to think, that the police of antient states was any way comparable to that of modern, or that men had then equal security, either at home, or in their journeys by land or water? I question not, but every impartial examiner would give us the preference in this particular[n113].

THUS, upon comparing the whole, it seems impossible to assign any just reason, why the world should have been more populous in antient than in modern times. The equality of property, amongst the antients, liberty, and the small divisions of their states, were indeed favourable to the propagation of mankind: But their wars were more bloody and destructive, their governments more factious and unsettled, commerce and manufactures more feeble and languishing, and the general police more loose and irregular. These latter disadvantages seem to form a sufficient counterbalance to the former advantages; and rather favour the opposite opinion to that which commonly prevails with regard to this subject.

BUT there is no reasoning, it may be said, against matter of fact. If it appear, that the world was then more populous than at present, we may be assur'd that our conjectures are false, and that we have overlook'd some material circumstance in the comparison. This I readily own: All our preceding reasonings, I acknowledge to be mere trifling, or, at least, small skirmishes and frivolous rencounters, which decide nothing. But unluckily the main combat, where we compare facts, cannot be render'd much more decisive. The facts deliver'd by antient authors, are either so uncertain or so imperfect as to afford us nothing decisive in this matter. How indeed could it be otherwise? The very facts which we must oppose to them, in computing the greatness of modern states, are far from being either certain or compleat. Many grounds of calculation, proceeded on by celebrated writers, are little better than those of the Emperor _Heliogabalus_, who form'd an estimate of the immense greatness of _Rome_, from ten thousand pound weight of cobwebs which had been found in that city[n114]. 'TIS to be remark'd, that all kinds of numbers are uncertain in antient manuscripts, and have been subject to much greater corruptions than any other part of the text; and that for a very obvious reason. Any alteration, in other places, commonly affects the sense or grammar, and is more readily perceiv'd by the reader and transcriber.

FEW enumerations of inhabitants have been made of any tract of country by any antient author of good authority, so as to afford us a large enough view for comparison.

'TIS probable, that there was formerly a good foundation for the number of citizens assign'd to any free city; because they enter'd for a share of the government, and there were exact registers kept of them. But as the number of slaves is seldom mention'd, this leaves us in as great uncertainty as ever, with regard to the populousness even of single cities.

THE first page of _Thucydides_ is, in my opinion, the commencement of real history. All preceding narrations are so intermix'd with fable, that philosophers ought to abandon them, in a great measure, to the embellishment of poets and orators[n115]. WITH regard to remote times, the numbers of people assign'd are often ridiculous, and lose all credit and authority. The free citizens of _Sybaris_, able to bear arms, and actually drawn out in battle, were 300,000. They encounter'd at _Siagra_ with 100,000 citizens of _Crotona_, another _Greek_ city contiguous to them; and were defeated. This is _Diodorus Siculus_'s[n116] account; and is very seriously insisted on by that historian. _Strabo_[n117] also mentions the same number of _Sybarites_.

DIODORUS SICULUS[n118], enumerating the inhabitants of _Agrigentum_, when it was destroy'd by the _Carthaginians_, says, that they amounted to 20,000 citizens, 200,000 strangers, besides slaves, who, in so opulent a city as he represents it, would probably be, at least, as numerous. We must remark, that the women and the children are not included; and that therefore, upon the whole, the city must contain near two millions of inhabitants[n119]. And what was the reason of so immense an increase? They were very industrious in cultivating the neighbouring fields, not exceeding a small _English_ county; and they traded with their wine and oil to _Africa_, which, at that time, had none of these commodities.

PTOLEMY, says _Theocritus_[n120], commands 33,339 cities. I suppose the singularity of the number was the reason of assigning it. _Diodorus Siculus_[n121] gives three millions of inhabitants to _AEgypt_, a very small number: But then he makes the number of their cities amount to 18,000: An evident contradiction.

HE says[n122], the people were formerly seven millions. Thus remote times are always most envy'd and admir'd.

THAT _Xerxes_'s army was extremely numerous, I can readily believe; both from the great extent of his empire, and from the foolish practice of the Eastern nations, of encumbering their camp with a superfluous multitude: But will any reasonable man cite _Herodotus_'s wonderful narrations as an authority? There is something very rational, I own, in _Lysias_'s[n123] argument upon this subject. Had not _Xerxes_'s army been incredibly numerous, says he, he had never made a bridge over the _Hellespont_: It had been much easier to have transported his men over so short a passage, with the numerous shipping of which he was master.

POLYBIUS[n124] says, that the _Romans_, betwixt the first and second _Punic_ wars, being threaten'd with an invasion from the _Gauls_, muster'd all their own forces, and those of their allies, and found them amount to seven hundred thousand men able to bear arms. A great number surely, and which, when join'd to the slaves, is probably not less, if not rather more than that extent of country affords at present[n125]. The enumeration too seems to have been made with some exactness; and _Polybius_ gives us the detail of the particulars. But might not the number be magnify'd, in order to encourage the people?

DIODORUS SICULUS[n126] makes the same enumeration amount to near a million. These variations are suspicious. He plainly too supposes, that _Italy_ in his time was not so populous: Another very suspicious circumstance. For who can believe, that the inhabitants of that country diminish'd from the time of the first _Punic_ war to that of the _triumvirates_?

JULIUS CAESAR, according to _Appian_[n127], encounter'd four millions of _Gauls_, kill'd one million, and took another million prisoners[n128]. Supposing the numbers of the enemy's army and of the kill'd could be exactly assign'd, which never is possible; how could it be known how often the same man return'd into the armies, or how distinguish the new from the old levy'd soldiers? No attention ought ever to be given to such loose, exaggerated calculations; especially where the author tells us not the mediums upon which the calculations were form'd.

PATERCULUS[n129] makes the number kill'd by _Caesar_ amount only to 400,000: A much more probable account, and more easily reconcil'd to the history of these wars given by that conqueror himself in his commentaries.

ONE would imagine, that every circumstance of the life and actions of _Dionysius_ the elder might be regarded as authentic, and free from all fabulous exaggerations; both because he liv'd at a time when letters flourish'd most in _Greece_, and because his chief historian was _Philistus_, a man allow'd to be of great genius, and who was a courtier and minister of that prince. But can we admit, that he had a standing army of 100,000 foot, 10,000 horse, and a fleet of 400 gallies[n130]? These, we may observe, were mercenary forces, and subsisted upon their pay, like our armies in _Europe_. For the citizens were all disarm'd; and when _Dion_ afterwards invaded _Sicily_, and call'd on his countrymen to vindicate their liberty, he was oblig'd to bring arms along with him, which he distributed among those who join'd him[n131]. In a state where agriculture alone flourishes, there may be many inhabitants; and if these be all arm'd and disciplin'd, a great force may be call'd out upon occasion: But great numbers of mercenary troops can never be maintain'd, without either trade and manufactures, or very extensive dominions. The United Provinces never were masters of such a force by sea and land, as that which is said to belong to _Dionysius_; yet they possess as large a territory, perfectly well cultivated, and have infinitely more resources from their commerce and industry. _Diodorus Siculus_ allows, that, even in his time, the army of _Dionysius_ appear'd incredible; that is, as I interpret it, it was entirely a fiction, and the opinion arose from the exaggerated flattery of the courtiers, and perhaps from the vanity and policy of the tyrant himself.

THE critical art may very justly be suspected of temerity, when it pretends to correct or dispute the plain testimony of antient historians by any probable or analogical reasonings: Yet the licence of authors upon all subjects, particularly with regard to numbers, is so great, that we ought still to retain a kind of doubt or reserve, whenever the facts advanc'd depart, in the least, from the common bounds of nature and experience. I shall give an instance with regard to modern history. Sir _William Temple_ tells us, in his memoirs, that, having a free conversation with _Charles_ II. he took the opportunity of representing to that monarch the impossibility of introducing into this island the religion and government of _France_, chiefly on account of the great force requisite to subdue the spirit and liberty of so brave a people. "The _Romans_," says he, "were forc'd to keep up twelve legions for that purpose," a great absurdity[n132]; and _Cromwel_ left an army of near eighty thousand men. Must not this last fact be regarded as unquestion'd by future critics, when they find it asserted by a wife and learned minister of state, cotemporary to the fact, and who address'd his discourse, upon an ungrateful subject, to a great monarch, who was also cotemporary, and who himself broke those very forces about fourteen years before? Yet, by the most undoubted authority, we may insist, that _Cromwel_'s army, when he died, did not amount to half the number here mention'd[n133].

'TIS a very usual fallacy, to consider all the ages of antiquity as one period, and to compute the numbers contain'd in the great cities mention'd by antient authors, as if these cities had been all cotemporary. The _Greek_ colonies flourish'd extremely in _Sicily_ during the age of _Alexander_: But in _Augustus_'s time they were so decay'd, that almost all the product of that fertile island was consum'd in _Italy_[n134].

LET us now examine the numbers of inhabitants assign'd to particular cities in antiquity; and omitting the numbers of _Nineveh, Babylon_, and the _Egyptian Thebes_, let us confine ourselves to the sphere of real history, to the _Grecian_ and _Roman_ states. I must own, the more I consider this subject, the more am I inclin'd to scepticism, with regard to the great populousness ascrib'd to antient times.

ATHENS is said by _Plato_[n135] to be a very great city; and it was surely the greatest of all the _Greek_[n136] cities, except _Syracuse_, which was nearly about the same size in _Thucydides_'s[n137] time, and afterwards increas'd beyond it. For _Cicero_[n138] mentions it as the greatest of all the _Greek_ cities in his time; not comprehending, I suppose, either _Antioch_ or _Alexandria_ under that denomination. _Athenaeus_[n139] says, that, by the enumeration of _Demetrius Phalereus_, there were in _Athens_ 21,000 citizens, 10,000 strangers, and 400,000 slaves. This number is very much insisted on by those whose opinion I call in question, and is esteem'd a fundamental fact to their purpose: But, in my opinion, there is no point of criticism more certain, than that _Athenaeus_, and _Ctesicles_, whom he cites, are here mistaken, and that the number of slaves is augmented by a whole cypher, and ought not to be regarded as more than 40,000.

_First_, WHEN the number of citizens is said to be 21,000 by _Athenaeus_[n140], men of full age are only understood. For (1.) _Herodotus_[n141] says, that _Aristagoras_, ambassador from the _Ionians_, found it harder to deceive one _Spartan_ than 30,000 _Athenians_; meaning, in a loose way, the whole state, suppos'd to be met in one popular assembly, excluding the women and children. (2.) _Thucydides_[n142] says, that, making allowance for all the absentees in the fleet, army, garrisons, and for people employ'd in their private affairs, the _Athenian_ assembly never rose to five thousand. (3.) The forces enumerated by the same historian[n143], being all citizens, and amounting to 13,000 heavy-arm'd infantry, prove the same method of calculation; as also the whole tenor of the _Greek_ historians, who always understand men of full age, when they assign the number of citizens in any republic. Now, these being but the fourth of the inhabitants, the free _Athenians_ were by this account 84,000; the strangers 40,000; and the slaves, calculating by the smaller number, and allowing that they marry'd and propagated at the same rate with freemen, were 160,000; and the whole inhabitants 284,000: A large enough number surely. The other number, 1,720,000, makes _Athens_ larger than _London_ and _Paris_ united.

_Secondly_, THERE were but 10,000 houses in _Athens_[n144].

_Thirdly_, THO' the extent of the walls, as given us by _Thucydides_[n145], be great, (_viz_. eighteen miles, beside the sea-coast); yet _Xenophon_[n146] says, there was much waste ground within the walls. They seem indeed to have join'd four distinct and separate cities[n147].

_Fourthly_, No insurrection of the slaves, nor suspicion of insurrection, are ever mention'd by historians; except one commotion of the miners[n148]. _Fifthly_, THE _Athenians_ treatment of their slaves is said by _Xenophon_[n149], and _Demosthenes_[n150], and _Plautus_[n151], to have been extremely gentle and indulgent: Which could never have been the case, had the disproportion been twenty to one. The disproportion is not so great in any of our colonies; and yet we are oblig'd to exercise a very rigorous military government over the negroes.

_Sixthly_, No man is ever esteem'd rich for possessing what may be reckon'd an equal distribution of property in any country, or even triple or quadruple that wealth. Thus every person in _England_ is computed by some to spend sixpence a-day: Yet is he esteem'd but poor who has five times that sum. Now, _Timarchus_ is said by _AEschines_[n152] to have been left in easy circumstances; but he was master only of ten slaves employ'd in manufactures. _Lysias_ and his brother, two strangers, were proscrib'd by the thirty for their great riches; tho' they had but sixty a-piece[n153]. _Demosthenes_ was left very rich by his father; yet he had no more than fifty-two slaves[n154]. His workhouse, of twenty cabinet-makers, is said to be a very considerable manufactory[n155].

_Seventhly_, DURING the _Decelian_ war, as the _Greek_ historians call it, 20,000 slaves deserted, and brought the _Athenians_ to great distress, as we learn from _Thucydides_[n156]. This could not have happen'd, had they been only the twentieth part. The best slaves would not desert.

_Eighthly_, XENOPHON[n157] proposes a scheme for entertaining by the public 10,000 slaves: And that so great a number may possibly be supported, any one will be convinc'd, says he, who considers the numbers we possess'd before the _Decelian_ war. A way of speaking altogether incompatible with the larger number of _Athenaeus_.

_Ninthly_, THE whole _census_ of the state of _Athens_ was less than 6000 talents. And tho' numbers in antient manuscripts be often suspected by critics, yet this is unexceptionable; both because _Demosthenes_[n158], who gives it, gives also the detail, which checks him; and because _Polybius_[n159] assigns the same number, and reasons upon it. Now, the most vulgar slave could yield by his labour an _obolus_ a-day, over and above his maintenance; as we learn from _Xenophon_[n160], who says, that _Nicias_'s overseer paid his master so much for slaves, whom he employ'd in digging of mines. If you will take the pains to estimate an _obolus_ a-day, and the slaves at 400,000, computing only at four years purchase, you will find the sum above 12,000 talents; even tho' allowance be made for the great number of holidays in _Athens_. Besides, many of the slaves would have a much greater value from their art. The lowest that _Demosthenes_[n161] estimates any of his father's slaves, is two minas a-head. And upon this supposition, it is a little difficult, I confess, to reconcile even the number of 40,000 slaves with the _census_ of 6000 talents.

_Tenthly_, CHIOS is said by _Thucydides_[n162] to contain more slaves than any _Greek_ city, except _Sparta. Sparta_ then had more than _Athens_, in proportion to the number of citizens. The _Spartans_ were 9000 in the town, 30,000 in the country[n163]. The male slaves, therefore, of full age, must have been more than 780,000; the whole more than 3,120,000. A number impossible to be maintain'd in a narrow, barren country, such as _Laconia_, which had no trade. Had the _Helotes_ been so very numerous, the murder of 2000 mention'd by _Thucydides_[n164], would have irritated them, without weakening them.

BESIDES, we are to consider, that the number assign'd by _Athenaeus_[n165], whatever it is, comprehends all the inhabitants of _Attica_, as well as those of _Athens_. The _Athenians_ affected much a country life, as we learn from _Thucydides_[n166]; and when they were all chas'd into town, by the invasion of their territory during the _Peloponnesian_ war, the city was not able to contain them; and they were oblig'd to lie in the porticoes, temples, and even streets, for want of lodging[n167].

THE same remark is to be extended to all the other _Greek_ cities; and when the number of the citizens is assign'd, we must always understand it of the inhabitants of the neighbouring country, as well as of the city. Yet, even with this allowance, it must be confess'd, that _Greece_ was a populous country, and exceeded what we could imagine of so narrow a territory, naturally not very fertile, and which drew no supplies of corn from other places. For excepting _Athens_, which traded to _Pontus_ for that commodity, the other cities seem to have subsisted chiefly from their neighbouring territory[n168].

RHODES is well known to have been a city of extensive commerce, and of great fame and splendor; yet it contain'd only 6000 citizens able to bear arms, when it was besieg'd by _Demetrius_[n169]. THEBES was always one of the capital cities of _Greece_[n170]: But the number of its citizens exceeded not those of _Rhodes_[n171]. _Phliasia_ is said to be a small city by _Xenophon_[n172]; yet we find, that it contain'd 6000 citizens[n173]. I pretend not to reconcile these two facts. Perhaps, _Xenophon_ calls _Phliasia_ a small town, because it made but a small figure in _Greece_, and maintain'd only a subordinate alliance with _Sparta_; or perhaps the country belonging to it, was extensive, and most of the citizens were employ'd in the cultivation of it, and dwelt in the neighbouring villages.

MANTINAEA was equal to any city in _Arcadia_[n174]: Consequently it was equal to _Megalopolis_, which was fifty stadia, or six miles and a quarter in circumference[n175]. But _Mantinaea_ had only 3000 citizens[n176]. The _Greek_ cities, therefore, contain'd often fields and gardens, along with the houses; and we cannot judge of them by the extent of their walls. _Athens_ contain'd no more than 10,000 houses; yet its walls, with the sea-coast, were above twenty miles in extent. _Syracuse_ was twenty-two miles in circumference; yet was scarce ever spoke of by the antients as more populous than _Athens_. _Babylon_ was a square of fifteen miles, or sixty miles in circuit; but it contain'd large cultivated fields and inclosures, as we learn from _Pliny_. Tho' _Aurelian_'s wall was fifty miles in circumference[n177]; the circuit of all the thirteen divisions of _Rome_, taken apart, according to _Publius Victor_, was only about forty-three miles. When an enemy invaded the country, the whole inhabitants retir'd within the walls of the antient cities, along with their cattle, and furniture, and instruments of husbandry. And the great height to which the walls were rais'd, enabled a small number to defend them with facility.

SPARTA, says _Xenophon_[n178], is one of the cities of _Greece_ that has the fewest inhabitants. Yet _Polybius_[n179] says, that it was forty-eight stadia in circumference, and was round.

ALL the _AEtolians_ able to bear arms in _Antipater_'s time, deducting some few garrisons, were but ten thousand men[n180].

POLYBIUS[n181] tells us, that the _Achaean_ league might, without any inconvenience, march 30 or 40,000 men: And this account seems very probable; for that league comprehended the greatest part of _Peloponnesus_. Yet _Pausanias_[n182], speaking of the same period, says, that all the _Achaeans_ able to bear arms, even when several manumitted slaves were join'd to them, did not amount to fifteen thousand.

THE _Thessalians_, till their final conquest by the _Romans_, were, in all ages, turbulent, factious, seditious, disorderly[n183]. 'Tis not therefore natural to suppose, that that part of _Greece_ abounded much in people.

WE are told by _Thucydides_[n184], that the part of _Peloponnesus_ lying in the neighbourhood of _Pylos_, was desart and uncultivated. _Herodotus_ says[n185], that _Macedonia_ was full of lions and wild bulls; animals which can only inhabit in vast unpeopled forests. These were the two extremities of _Greece_. THE whole inhabitants of _Epirus_, of all ages, sexes, and conditions, who were sold by _Paulus AEmilius_, amounted only to 150,000[n186]. Yet _Epirus_ might be double the extent of _Yorkshire_.

JUSTIN[n187] tells us, that when _Philip_ of _Macedon_ was declar'd head of the _Greek_ confederacy, he call'd a congress of all the states, except the _Lacedemonians_, who refus'd to concur; and he found the force of the whole, upon computation, to amount to 200,000 infantry and 15,000 cavalry. This must be understood to be all the citizens capable of bearing arms. For as the _Greek_ republics maintain'd no mercenary forces, and had no militia distinct from the whole body of the citizens, it is not conceivable what other medium there could be of computation. That such an army could ever by _Greece_ be brought into the field, and be maintain'd there, is contrary to all history. Upon this supposition, therefore, we may thus reason. The free _Greeks_ of all ages and sexes were 860,000. The slaves, computing them by the number of _Athenian_ slaves as above, who seldom marry'd or had families, were double the male citizens of full age, _viz_. 430,000. And the whole inhabitants of antient _Greece_, excepting _Laconia_, were about one million two hundred and ninety thousand: No mighty number, nor much exceeding what may be found at present in _Scotland_, a country nearly of the same extent, and very indifferently peopled.

WE may now consider the numbers of people in _Rome_ and _Italy_, and collect all the lights afforded us by scatter'd passages in antient authors. We shall find, upon the whole, a great difficulty in fixing any opinion on that head; and no reason to support those exaggerated calculations, so much insisted on by modern writers.

DIONYSIUS HALICARNASSAEUS[n188] says, that the antient walls of _Rome_ were nearly of the same compass with those of _Athens_, but that the suburbs ran out to a great extent; and it was difficult to tell, where the town ended or the country begun. In some places of _Rome_, it appears, from the same author[n189], from _Juvenal_[n190], and from other antient writers[n191], that the houses were high, and families liv'd in separate storeys, one above another: But 'tis probable, these were only the poorer citizens, and only in some few streets. If we may judge from the younger _Pliny_'s[n192] account of his house, and from _Bartoli_'s plans of antient buildings, the men of quality had very spacious palaces; and their buildings were like the _Chinese_ houses at this day, where each apartment is separate from the rest, and rises no higher than a single storey. To which if we add, that the _Roman_ nobility much affected very extensive porticoes, and even woods[n193] in town; we may perhaps allow _Vossius_ (tho' there is no manner of reason for it) to read the famous passage of the elder _Pliny_[n194] his own way, without admitting the extravagant consequences which he draws from it. THE number of citizens who receiv'd corn by the public distribution in _Augustus_'s time, were two hundred thousand[n195]. This one would esteem a pretty certain ground of calculation: Yet is it attended with such circumstances as throw us back into doubt and uncertainty.

DID the poorer citizens only receive the distribution? It was calculated, to be sure, chiefly for their benefit. But it appears from a passage of _Cicero_[n196], that the rich might also take their portion, and that it was esteem'd no reproach in them to apply for it.

TO whom was the corn given; whether only to heads of families, or to every man, woman, and child? The portion every month was five _modii_ to each[n197], (about 5/6 of a bushel.) This was too little for a family, and too much for an individual. A very accurate antiquarian[n198], therefore, infers, that it was given to every man of full years: But he allows the matter to be uncertain.

WAS it strictly inquir'd, whether the claimant liv'd within the precincts of _Rome_, or was it sufficient that he presented himself at the monthly distribution? This last seems more probable[n199]. WERE there no false claimants? We are told[n200], that _Caesar_ struck off at once 170,000, who had crept in without a just title; and it is very little probable, that he remedy'd all abuses.

BUT, lastly, what proportion of slaves must we assign to these citizens? This is the most material question; and the most uncertain. 'Tis very doubtful, whether _Athens_ can be establish'd as a rule for _Rome_. Perhaps the _Athenians_ had more slaves, because they employ'd them in manufactures, for which a capital city, like _Rome_, seems not so proper. Perhaps, on the other hand, the _Romans_ had more slaves, on account of their superior luxury and riches.

THERE were exact bills of mortality kept in _Rome_; but no antient author has given us the number of burials, except _Suetonius_[n201], who tells us, that in one season there were 30,000 names carried to the temple of _Libitina_: But this was during a plague; which can afford no certain foundation for any inference.

THE public corn, tho' distributed only to 200,000 citizens, affected very considerably the whole agriculture of _Italy_[n202]: A fact no way reconcilable to some modern exaggerations with regard to the inhabitants of that country.

THE best ground of conjecture I can find concerning the greatness of antient _Rome_, is this: We are told by _Herodian_[n203], that _Antioch_ and _Alexandria_ were very little inferior to _Rome_. It appears from _Diodorus Siculus_[n204], that one straight street of _Alexandria_, reaching from port to port, was five miles long; and as _Alexandria_ was much more extended in length than breadth, it seems to have been a city nearly of the bulk of _Paris_[n205]; and _Rome_ might be about the size of _London_. THERE liv'd in _Alexandria_, in _Diodorus Siculus_'s time[n206], 300,000 free people, comprehending, I suppose, women and children[n207]. But what number of slaves? Had we any just ground to fix these at an equal number with the free inhabitants, it would favour the foregoing calculation.

THERE is a passage in _Herodian_, which is a little surprising. He says positively, that the palace of the Emperor was as large as all the rest of the city[n208]. This was _Nero_'s golden house, which is indeed represented by _Suetonius_[n209] and _Pliny_ as of an enormous extent[n210]; but no power of imagination can make us conceive it to bear any proportion to such a city as _London_.

WE may observe, had the historian been relating _Nero_'s extravagance, and had he made use of such an expression, it would have had much less weight; these rhetorical exaggerations being so apt to creep into an author's style, even when the most chaste and correct. But 'tis mentioned by _Herodian_ only by the by, in relating the quarrels betwixt _Geta_ and _Caracalla_.

IT appears from the same historian[n211], that there was then much land uncultivated, and put to no manner of use; and he ascribes it as a great praise to _Pertinax_, that he allow'd every one to take such land, either in _Italy_ or elsewhere, and cultivate it as he pleas'd, without paying any taxes. _Lands uncultivated, and put to no manner of use_! This is not heard of in any part of Christendom; except perhaps in some remote parts of _Hungary_, as I have been inform'd. And it surely corresponds very ill with that idea of the extreme populousness of antiquity, so much insisted on. WE learn from _Vopiscus_[n212], that there was in _Etruria_ much fertile land uncultivated, which the Emperor _Aurelian_ intended to convert into vineyards, in order to furnish the _Roman_ people with a gratuitous distribution of wine: A very proper expedient to dispeople still farther that capital, and all the neighbouring territories.

IT may not be amiss to take notice of the account which _Polybius_[n213] gives of the great herds of swine to be met with in _Tuscany_ and _Lombardy_, as well as in _Greece_, and of the method of feeding them which was then practis'd. "There are great herds of swine," says he, "throughout all _Italy_, particularly, in former times, thro' _Etruria_ and _Cisalpine Gaul_. And a herd frequently contains a thousand or more swine. When one of these herds in feeding meets with another, they mix together; and the swine-herds have no other expedient to separate them than to go to different quarters, where they found their horn; and these animals, being accustom'd to that signal, run immediately each to the horn of his own keeper. Whereas in _Greece_, if the herds of swine happen to mix in the forests, he who has the greatest flock, takes cunningly the opportunity of driving all away. And thieves are very apt to purloin the straggling hogs, which have wander'd to a great distance from their keeper, in search of food."

MAY we not infer from this account, that the North of _Italy_ was then much less peopled, and worse cultivated, than at present? How could these vast herds be fed in a country so thick of inclosures, so improv'd by agriculture, so divided by farms, so planted with vines and corn intermingled together? I must confess, that _Polybius_'s relation has more the air of that oeconomy which is to be met with in our _American_ colonies, than the management of an _European_ country.

WE meet with a reflection in _Aristotle_'s[n214] ethics, which seems to me unaccountable on any supposition, and by proving too much in favour of our present reasoning, may be thought really to prove nothing. That philosopher, treating of friendship, and observing, that that relation ought neither to be contracted to a very few, nor extended over a great multitude, illustrates his opinion by the following argument. "In like manner," says he, "as a city cannot subsist, if it either have so few inhabitants as ten, or so many as a hundred thousand; so is there a mediocrity requir'd in the number of friends; and you destroy the essence of friendship by running into either extreme." What! impossible, that a city can contain a hundred thousand inhabitants! Had _Aristotle_ never seen nor heard of a city which was near so populous? This, I must own, passes my comprehension.

PLINY[n215] tells us, that _Seleucia_, the seat of the _Greek_ empire in the East, was reported to contain 600,000 people. _Carthage_ is said by _Strabo_[n216] to have contain'd 700,000. The inhabitants of _Pekin_ are not much more numerous. _London, Paris_, and _Constantinople_, may admit of nearly the same computation; at least, the two latter cities do not exceed it. _Rome, Alexandria, Antioch_, we have already spoke of. From the experience of past and present ages, one might conjecture, that there is a kind of impossibility, that any city could ever rise much beyond this proportion. Whether the grandeur of a city be founded on commerce or on empire, there seem to be invincible obstacles, which prevent its farther progress. The seats of vast monarchies, by introducing extravagant luxury, irregular expence, idleness, dependence, and false ideas of rank and superiority, are improper for commerce. Extensive commerce checks itself, by raising the price of all labour and commodities. When a great court engages the attendance of a numerous nobility, possess'd of overgrown fortunes, the middling gentry remain in their provincial towns, where they can make a figure on a moderate income. And if the dominions of a state arrive at an enormous size, there necessarily arise many capitals, in the remoter provinces, whither all the inhabitants, except a few courtiers, repair, for education, fortune, and amusement[n217]. _London_, by uniting extensive commerce and middling empire, has, perhaps, arriv'd at a greatness, which no city will ever be able to exceed.

CHUSE _Dover_ or _Calais_ for a center: Draw a circle of two hundred miles radius: You comprehend _London, Paris_, the _Netherlands_, the _United Provinces_, and some of the best cultivated counties of _France_ and _England_. It may safely, I think, be affirm'd, that no spot of ground can be found, in antiquity, of equal extent, which contain'd near so many great and populous cities, and was so stock'd with riches and inhabitants. To balance, in both periods, the states, which possess'd most art, knowledge, civility, and the best police, seems the truest method of comparison.

'TIS an observation of _L'Abbe du Bos_[n218], that _Italy_ is warmer at present than it was in antient times. "The annals of _Rome_ tell us," says he, "that in the year 480. _ab_ U.C. the winter was so severe that it destroy'd the trees. The _Tyber_ froze in _Rome_, and the ground was cover'd with snow for forty days. When _Juvenal_[n219] describes a superstitious woman, he represents her as breaking the ice of the _Tyber_, that she might perform her ablutions."
    ""$Hybernum fracta glacie descendet in amnem,$ //
    $Ter matutino Tyberi mergetur.$""
"He speaks of that river's freezing as a common event. Many passages of _Horace_ suppose the streets of _Rome_ full of snow and ice. We should have more certainty with regard to this point, had the antients known the use of thermometers: But their writers, without intending it, give us information, sufficient to convince us, that the winters are now much more temperate at _Rome_ than formerly. At present, the _Tyber_ no more freezes at _Rome_ than the _Nile_ at _Cairo_. The _Romans_ esteem the winter very rigorous, if the snow lies two days, and if one sees for eight and forty hours a few icicles hang from a fountain that has a north exposition."

THE observation of this ingenious critic may be extended to other _European_ climates. Who could discover the mild climate of _France_ in _Diodorus Siculus_'s[n220] description of that _Gaul_? "As it is a northern climate," says he, "it is infested with cold to an extreme degree. In cloudy weather, instead of rain, there fall great snows; and in clear weather it there freezes so excessive hard, that the rivers acquire bridges of their own substance, over which, not only single travellers may pass, but large armies, accompany'd with all their baggage and loaded waggons, And there being many rivers in _Gaul_, the _Rhone_, the _Rhine_, &c. almost all of them are froze over; and 'tis usual, in order to prevent falling, to cover the ice with chaff and straw, at the places where the road passes."

NORTH of the _Cevennes_, says _Strabo_[n221], _Gaul_ produces not figs and olives: And the vines, which have been planted, bear not grapes, that will ripen.

OVID positively maintains, with all the serious affirmation of prose, that the _Euxine_ sea was frozen over every winter in his time; and he appeals to _Roman_ governors, whom he names, for the truth of his assertion[n222]. This seldom or never happens at present in the latitude of _Tomi_, whither _Ovid_ was banish'd. All the complaints of the same poet seem to mark a rigour of the seasons, which is scarce experienc'd at present in _Petersburg_ or _Stockholm_.

TOURNEFORT, a _Provencal_, who had travell'd into the same countries, observes, that there is not a finer climate in the world: And he asserts, that nothing but _Ovid_'s melancholy could have given him such dismal ideas of it. But the facts mention'd by that poet, are too circumstantiate to bear any such interpretation.

POLYBIUS[n223] says, that the climate in _Arcadia_ was very cold, and the air moist.

"ITALY," says _Varro_[n224], "is the most temperate climate in _Europe_. The inland parts (_Gaul, Germany_, and _Pannonia_, no doubt) have almost perpetual winter."

THE northern parts of _Spain_, according to _Strabo_[n225], are but ill inhabited, because of the great cold.

ALLOWING, therefore, this remark to be just, that _Europe_ is become warmer than formerly; how can we account for it? Plainly, by no other method, but by supposing, that the land is at present much better cultivated, and that the woods are clear'd, which formerly threw a shade upon the earth, and kept the rays of the sun from penetrating to it. Out northern colonies in _America_ become more temperate, in proportion as the woods are fell'd[n226]; but, in general, every one may remark, that cold still makes itself much more severely felt, both in North and South _America_, than in places under the same latitude in _Europe_.

SASERNA, quoted by _Columella_[n227], affirm'd, that the disposition of the heavens was alter'd before his time, and that the air had become much milder and warmer; as appears hence, says he, that many places now abound with vineyards and olive plantations, which formerly, by reason of the rigour of the climate, could raise none of these productions. Such a change, if real, will be allow'd an evident sign of the better cultivation and peopling of countries before the age of _Saserna_[n228]; and if it be continu'd to the present times, is a proof, that these advantages have been continually increasing throughout this part of the world.

LET us now cast our eye over all the countries which were the scene of antient and modern history, and compare their past and present situation. We shall not, perhaps, find such foundation for the complaint of the present emptiness and desolation of the world. _AEgypt_ is represented by _Maillet_, to whom we owe the best account of it, as extremely populous; tho' he esteems the number of its inhabitants to be diminished. _Syria_, and the Lesser _Asia_, as well as the coast of _Barbary_, I can readily own, to be very desart in comparison of their antient condition. The depopulation of _Greece_ is also very obvious. But whether the country now call'd _Turky in Europe_ may not, in general, contain as many inhabitants as during the flourishing period of _Greece_, may be a little doubtful. The _Thracians_ seem then to have liv'd like the _Tartars_ at present, by pasturage and plunder[n229]: The _Getes_ were still more unciviliz'd[n230]: And the _Illyrians_ were no better[n231]. These occupy nine tenths of that country: And tho' the government of the _Turks_ be not very favourable to industry and propagation; yet it preserves, at least, peace and order amongst the inhabitants; and is preferable to that barbarous, unsettled condition, in which they antiently liv'd. POLAND and _Muscovy_ in _Europe_ are not populous; but are certainly much more so than the antient _Sarmatia_ and _Scythia_; where no husbandry or agriculture was ever heard of, and pasturage was the sole art by which the people were maintain'd. The like observation may be extended to _Denmark_ and _Sweden_. No one ought to esteem the immense swarms of people, which formerly came from the North, and over-ran all _Europe_, to be any objection to this opinion. Where a whole nation, or even half of it, remove their seat; 'tis easy to imagine what a prodigious multitude they must form; with what desperate valour they must make their attacks; and how the terror they strike into the invaded nations will make these magnify, in their imagination, both the courage and multitude of the invaders. _Scotland_ is neither extensive nor populous; but were the half of its inhabitants to seek new seats, they would form a colony as large as the _Teutons_ and _Cimbri_; and would shake all _Europe_, supposing it in no better condition for defence than formerly.

GERMANY has surely at present twenty times more inhabitants than in antient times, when they cultivated no ground, and each tribe valu'd itself on the extensive desolation which it spread around; as we learn from _Caesar_[n232], and _Tacitus_[n233], and _Strabo_[n234]. A proof, that the division into small republics will not alone render a nation populous, unless attended with the spirit of peace, order, and industry. THE barbarous condition of _Britain_ in former times is well known, and the thinness of its inhabitants may easily be conjectur'd, both from their barbarity, and from a circumstance mention'd by _Herodian_[n235], that all _Britain_ was marshy, even in _Severus_'s time, after the _Romans_ had been fully settled in it above a whole century.

'TIS not easily imagin'd, that the _Gauls_ were antiently much more advanc'd in the arts of life than their northern neighbours; since they travell'd to this island for their education in the mysteries of the religion and philosophy of the _Druids_[n236]. I cannot, therefore, think, that _Gaul_ was then near so populous as _France_ is at present.

WERE we to believe, indeed, and join together the testimony of _Appian_, and that of _Diodorus Siculus_, we must admit an incredible populousness in _Gaul_. The former historian[n237] says, that there were 400 nations in that country; the latter[n238] affirms, that the largest of the _Gallic_ nations consisted of 200,000 men, besides women and children, and the least of 50,000. Calculating therefore, at a medium, we must admit of near 200 millions of people, in a country, which we esteem populous at present, tho' suppos'd to contain little more than twenty[n239]. Such calculations, therefore, by their extravagance lose all manner of authority. We may observe, that that equality of property, to which the populousness of antiquity may be ascrib'd, had no place amongst the _Gauls_[n240]. Their intestine wars also, before _Caesar_'s time, were almost perpetual[n241]. And _Strabo_[n242] observes, that, tho' all _Gaul_ was cultivated, yet it was not cultivated with any skill or care; the genius of the inhabitants leading them less to arts than arms, till their slavery to _Rome_ produc'd peace among themselves.

CAESAR[n243] enumerates very particularly the great forces which were levy'd in _Belgium_, to oppose his conquests; and makes them amount to 208,000. These were not the whole people able to bear arms in _Belgium_: For the same historian tells us, that the _Bellovaci_ could have brought a hundred thousand men into the field, tho' they engag'd only for sixty. Taking the whole, therefore, in this proportion of ten to six, the sum of fighting men in all the states of _Belgium_, was about 350,000; the whole inhabitants a million and a half. And _Belgium_ being about the fourth of _Gaul_, that country might contain six millions, which is not the third of its present inhabitants[n244]. THE antient _Helvetia_ was 250 miles in length, and 180 in breadth, according to _Caesar_[n245]; yet contain'd only 360,000 inhabitants. The canton of _Berne_ alone has, at present, as many people.

AFTER this computation of _Appian_ and _Diodorus Siculus_, I know not whether I dare affirm, that the modern _Dutch_ are more numerous than the antient _Batavi_.

SPAIN is decay'd from what it was three centuries ago; but if we step backward two thousand years, and consider the restless, turbulent, unsettled condition of its inhabitants, we may probably be inclin'd to think, that it is now much more populous. Many _Spaniards_ kill'd themselves when depriv'd of their arms by the _Romans_[n246]. It appears from _Plutarch_,[n247] that robbery and plunder were esteem'd honourable amongst the _Spaniards. Hirtius_[n248] represents in the same light the situation of that country in _Caesar_'s time; and he says, that every man was oblig'd to live in castles and wall'd towns for his security. 'Twas not till its final conquest under _Augustus_, that these disorders were repress'd[n249]. The account which _Strabo_[n250] and _Justin_[n251] give of _Spain_, corresponds exactly with those above mention'd. How much, therefore, must it diminish from our idea of the populousness of antiquity, when we find, that _Cicero_, comparing _Italy, Afric, Gaul, Greece_, and _Spain_, mentions the great number of inhabitants, as the peculiar circumstance which render'd this latter country formidable[n252].

ITALY, 'tis probable however, has decay'd: But how many great cities does it still contain; _Venice, Genoa, Pavia, Turin, Milan, Naples, Florence, Leghorn_, which either subsisted not in antient times,or were then very inconsiderable? If we reflect on this, we shall not be apt to carry matters to so great an extreme as is usual, with regard to this subject.

WHEN the _Roman_ authors complain, that _Italy_, which formerly exported corn, became dependent on all the provinces for its daily bread, they never ascribe this alteration to the increase of its inhabitants, but to the neglect of tillage and agriculture[n253]. A natural effect of that pernicious practice of importing corn, in order to distribute it _gratis_ among the _Roman_ citizens, and a very bad means of multiplying the inhabitants of any country[n254]. The _sportula_, so much talk'd of by _Martial_ and _Juvenal_, being presents regularly made by the great lords to their smaller clients, must have had a like tendency to produce idleness, debauchery, and a continual decay amongst the people. The parish-rates have at present the same bad consequences in _England_.

WERE I to assign a period, when I imagine this part of the world might possibly contain more inhabitants than at present, I should pitch upon the age of _Trajan_ and the _Antonines_; the great extent of the _Roman_ empire being then civiliz'd and cultivated, settled almost in a profound peace both foreign and domestic, and living under the same regular police and government[n255]. But we are told, that all extensive governments, especially absolute monarchies, are destructive to population, and contain a secret vice and poison, which destroy the effect of all these promising appearances[n256]. To confirm this, there is a passage, cited from _Plutarch_[n257], which being somewhat singular, we shall here examine it.

THAT author, endeavouring to account for the silence of many of the oracles, says, that it may be ascrib'd to the present desolation of the world, proceeding from former wars and factions; which common calamity, he adds, has fallen heavier upon _Greece_ than on any other country; insomuch, that the whole could scarce at present furnish three thousand warriors; a number, which, in the time of the _Median_ war, were supply'd by the single city of _Megara_. The gods, therefore, who affect works of dignity and importance, have supprest many of their oracles, and deign not to use so many interpreters of their will to so diminutive a people.

I MUST confess, that this passage contains so many difficulties, that I know not what to make of it. You may observe, that _Plutarch_ assigns for a cause of the decay of mankind, not the extensive dominion of the _Romans_, but the former wars and factions of the several nations; all which were quieted by the _Roman_ arms. _Plutarch_'s reasoning, therefore, is directly contrary to the inference which is drawn from the fact he advances.

POLYBIUS supposes, that _Greece_ had become more prosperous and flourishing after the establishment of the _Roman_ yoke[n258]; and tho' that historian wrote before these conquerors had degenerated, from being the patrons, to be the plunderers of mankind; yet as we find from _Tacitus_[n259], that the severity of the emperors afterwards corrected the licence of the governors, we have no reason to think that extensive monarchy so destructive as it is often represented.

WE learn from _Strabo_[n260], that the _Romans_, from their regard to the _Greeks_, maintain'd to his time, most of the privileges and liberties of that celebrated nation; and _Nero_ afterwards rather increas'd them[n261]. How therefore can we imagine, that the _Roman_ yoke was so burthensome over that part of the world? The oppression of the proconsuls was check'd; and the magistracies in _Greece_ being all bestow'd in the several cities, by the free votes of the people, there was no great necessity for the competitors to attend the emperor's court. If great numbers went to seek their fortunes in _Rome_, and advance themselves by learning or eloquence, the commodities of their native country, many of them would return with the fortunes which they had acquir'd, and thereby enrich the _Grecian_ commonwealths.

BUT _Plutarch_ says, that the general depopulation had been more sensibly felt in _Greece_ than in any other country. How is this reconcileable to its superior privileges and advantages?

BESIDES, this passage, by proving too much, really proves nothing. _Only three thousand men able to bear arms in all Greece_! Who can admit so strange a proposition; especially if we consider the great number of _Greek_ cities, whose names still remain in history, and which are mention'd by writers long after the age of _Plutarch_? There are there surely ten times more people at present,when there scarce remains a city in all the bounds of antient _Greece_. That country is still tolerably cultivated, and furnishes a sure supply of corn, in case of any scarcity in _Spain, Italy_, or the South of _France_.

WE must observe, that the antient frugality of the _Greeks_, and their equality of property, still subsisted during the age of _Plutarch_; as appears from _Lucian_[n262]. Nor is there any ground to imagine, that that country was possess'd by a few masters, and a great number of slaves.

'TIS probable, indeed, that military discipline, being entirely useless, was extremely neglected in _Greece _ after the establishment of the _Roman_ empire; and if these commonwealths, formerly so warlike and ambitious, maintain'd each of them a small city-guard, to prevent mobbish disorders, 'tis all they had occasion for: And these, perhaps, did not amount to 3000 men, throughout all _Greece_. I own, that if _Plutarch_ had this fact in his eye, he is here guilty of a very gross paralogism, and assigns causes no way proportion'd to the effects. But is it so great a prodigy, that an author should fall into a mistake of this nature[n263]. BUT whatever force may remain in this passage of _Plutarch_, we shall endeavour to counterbalance it by as remarkable a passage in _Diodorus Siculus_, where the historian, after mentioning _Ninus_'s army of 1,700,000 foot and 200,000 horse, endeavours to support the credibility of this account, by some posterior facts; and adds, that we must not form a notion of the antient populousness of mankind from the present emptiness and depopulation which is spread over the world[n264]. Thus an author, who liv'd at that very period of antiquity which is represented as most populous[n265], complains of the desolation which then prevail'd, gives the preference to former times, and has recourse to antient fables as a foundation for his opinion. The humour of blaming the present, and admiring the past, is strongly rooted in human nature, and has an influence even on persons endu'd with the profoundest judgment and most extensive learning.

1. An ingenious writer has honour'd this discourse with an answer full of politeness, erudition, and good sense. So learn'd a refutation would have made the author suspect, that his reasonings were entirely overthrown, had he not us'd the precaution, from the beginning, to keep himself on the sceptical side; and having taken this advantage of the ground; he was enabled, tho' with much inferior forces, to preserve himself from a total defeat. That Reverend gentleman will always find, where his antagonist is so entrench'd, that it will be very difficult to force him. _Varro_, in such a situation, could defend himself against _Hanniabal, Pharnaces_ against _Caesar_. The author, however, very willingly acknowledges, that his antagonist has detected many mistakes both in his authorities and reasonings; and it was owing entirely to that gentleman's indulgence, that many more errors were not remark'd. In this edition, advantage has been taken of his learn'd animadversions, and the discourse has been render'd less imperfect than formerly.

2. _Columella_ says, lib. 3. cap. 8. that in _AEgypt_ and _Africa_ the bearing of twins was frequent, and even customary; _gemini partus familiares, ac paene solennes sunt_. If this was true, there is a physical difference both in countries and ages. For travellers make no such remarks of these countries at present. On the contrary, we are apt to suppose the northern nations more fertile. As those two countries were provinces of the _Roman_ empire, 'tis difficult, tho' not altogether absurd, to suppose that such a man as _Columella_ might be mistaken with regard to them.

4. This too is a good reason why the small pox does not depopulate countries so much as may at first sight be imagin'd. Where there is room for more people, they will always arise, even without the assistance of naturalization-bills. 'Tis remark'd by _Don Geronimo de Ustariz_, that the provinces of _Spain_ which send most people to the _Indies_, are most populous; which proceeds from their superior riches.

13. _Epist_. 122. The inhuman sports exhibited at _Rome_, may justly be consider'd too as an effect of the people's contempt for slaves, and was also a great cause of the general inhumanity of their princes and rulers. Who can read the accounts of the amphitheatrical entertainments without horror? Or who is surpris'd, that the emperors should treat that people in the same way the people treated their inferiors? One's humanity, on that occasion, is apt to renew the barbarous wish of _Caligula_, that the people had but one neck. A man cou'd almost be pleas'd, by a single blow, to put an end to such a race of monsters. You may thank God, says the author above cited, (_epist_. 7.) addressing himself to the _Roman_ people, that you have a master, (_viz_. the mild and merciful _Nero_), who is incapable of learning cruelty from your example. This was spoke in the beginning of his reign: But he fitted them very well afterwards; and no doubt was considerably improv'd by the sight of the barbarous objects, to which he had, from his infancy, been accustom'd.

14. We may here observe, that if domestic slavery really increas'd populousness, it would be an exception to the general rule, that the happiness of any society and its populousness are necessary attendants. A master, from humour or interest, may make his slaves very unhappy, and yet be careful, from interest, to increase their number. Their marriage is not a matter of choice with them, no more than any other action of their life.

18. As _servus_ was the name of the genus, and _verna_ of the species, without any correlative, this forms a strong presumption, that the latter were by far the least numerous. 'Tis an universal observation which we may form upon language, that where two related parts of a whole bear any proportion to each other, in numbers, rank, or consideration, there are always correlative terms invented, which answer to both the parts, and express their mutual relation. If they bear no proportion to each other, the term is only invented for the less, and marks its distinction from the whole. Thus _man_ and _woman, master_ and _servant, father_ and _son, prince_ and _subject, stranger_ and _citizen_, are correlative terms. But the words, _seaman, carpenter, smith, tailor_, &c. have no correspondent terms, which express those who are no seaman, no carpenter, _&c_. Languages differ very much with regard to the particular words where this distinction obtains; and may thence afford very strong inferences, concerning the manners and customs of different nations. The military government of the _Roman_ emperors had exalted the soldiery so high, that they balanc'd all the other orders of the state: Hence _miles_ and _paganus_ became relative terms; a thing, till then, unknown to antient, and still so to modern languages. Modern superstition exalted the clergy so high, that they overbalanc'd the whole state: Hence _clergy_ and _laity_ are terms oppos'd in all modern languages; and in these alone. And from the same principles I infer, that if the number of slaves bought by the _Romans_ from foreign countries, had not extremely exceeded those bred at home, _verna_ wou'd have had a correlative, which wou'd have express'd the former species of slaves. But these, it would seem, compos'd the main body of the antient slaves, and the latter were but a few exceptions.

19. _Verna_ is us'd by _Roman_ writers as a word equivalent to _scurra_, on account of the petulance and impudence of those slaves. _Mart_. lib. 1. ep. 42. _Horace_ also mentions the _vernae procaces_; and _Petronius_, cap. 24. _vernula urbanitas. Seneca, de provid_. cap. 1. _vernularum licentia_.

20. 'Tis computed in the _West Indies_ that a stock of slaves grow worse five _per cent_. every year, unless new slaves be bought to recruit them. They are not able to keep up their own number, even in those warm countries, where cloaths and provisions are so easily got. How much more must this happen in _European_ countries, and in or near great cities?

21. _Corn. Nepos in vita Attici_. We may remark, that _Attics_'s estate lay chiefly in _Epirus_, which being a remote, desolate place, would render it profitable for him to rear slaves there.

His impotence, it seems, was only regarded so far as his health or life might be affected by it. In other respects, he was full as valuable. The same reasoning is employed with regard to female slaves. _Quaeritur de ea muliere quae semper mortuos parit, an morbosa sit? et ait Sabinus, si vulvae vitio hoc contingit, morbosam esse. Id. lex_ 14. It has even been doubted, whether a woman pregnant was morbid or vitiated; and it is determined, that she is sound, not on account of the value of her offspring, but because it is the natural part or office of women to bear children. _Si mulier praegnans venerit, inter omnes convenit sanam eam esse. Maximum enim ac praecipuum munus foeminarum accipere ac tueri conceptum. Puerperam quoque sanam esse; si modo nihil extrinsecus accedit, quod corpus ejus in aliquam valetudinem immitteret.

It may justly be thought, that the liberty of divorces in _Rome_ was another discouragement to marriage. Such a practice prevents not quarrels from _humour_, but rather encreases them; and occasions also those from _interest_, which are much more dangerous and destructive.

In this view, the barbarous butchery committed by the first _Roman_ emperors was not, perhaps, so destructive to the public as we may imagine. These never ceas'd till they had extinguish'd all the illustrious families, which had enjoy'd the plunder of the world, during the latter ages of the republic. The new nobles who rose in their place, were less splendid, as we learn from _Tacit Ann_. lib. 3. cap. 55.

64. The antient soldiers, being free citizens, above the lowest rank, were all marry'd. Our modern soldiers are either forc'd to live unmarry'd, or their marriages turn to small account towards the increase of mankind. A circumstance which ought, perhaps, to be taken into consideration, as of some consequence in favour of the antients.

This goes so far as to cut off even the most common intercourse of civilities betwixt the Protestants and Catholics. Their cruel insurrections, and the severe revenges which they have taken of each other, are the causes of this mutual ill-will, which is the chief source of the disorder, poverty, and depopulation of that country. The _Greek_ factions I imagine to have been inflam'd still to a higher degree of rage; the revolutions being commonly more frequent, and the maxims of assassination much more avow'd and acknowledg'd.

84. We shall mention from _Diod. Siculus_ alone a few, which pass'd in the course of sixty years during the most shining age of _Greece_. There were banish'd from _Sybaris_ 500 of the nobles and their partisans; lib. 12. p. 77. _ex edit. Rhodomanni_. Of _Chians_, 600 citizens banish'd; lib. 13. p. 189. At _Ephesus_ 340 kill'd, 1000 banish'd; lib. 13. p. 223. Of _Cyrenians_ 500 nobles kill'd, all the rest banish'd; lib. 14. p. 263.

Upon the fall of the _Lacedemonians_, Democracies were restor'd in many cities, and severe vengeance taken of the nobles, after the _Greek_ manner. But matters did not end there. For the banish'd nobles, returning in many places, butcher'd their adversaries at _Phialae_, in _Corinth_, in _Megara_, in _Thliasia_. In this last place they kill'd 300 of the people; but these again revolting, kill'd above 600 of the nobles, and banish'd the rest; lib. 15. p. 357. In _Arcadia_ 1400 banish'd, besides many kill'd. The banish'd retir'd to _Sparta_ and to _Pallantium_: The latter deliver'd up to their countrymen, and all kill'd; lib. 15. p. 373. Of the banish'd from _Argos_ and _Thebes_, there were 500 in the _Spartan_ army; _id_. p. 374. Here is a detail of the most remarkable of _Agathocles_'s cruelties from the same author. The people before his usurpation had banish'd 600 nobles; lib. 19. p. 655. Afterwards, that tyrant, in concurrence with the people, kill'd 4000 nobles, and banish'd 6000; _id_. p. 647. He kill'd 4000 people at _Gela; id_. p. 741. By _Agathocles_'s brother 8000 banish'd from _Syracuse_; lib. 20. p. 757. The inhabitants of _AEgesta_, to the number of 40,000, were kill'd, man, woman, and child; and with tortures, for the sake of their money; _id_. p. 802. All the relations, _viz_. father, brother, children, grandfather, of his _Libyan_ army, kill'd; _id_. p. 803. He kill'd 7000 exiles after capitulation; _id_. p. 816.

'Tis true, he says, the law did not oblige absolutely to be at so much expence, not above a fourth. But without the favour of the people, no body was so much as safe; and this was the only way to gain it. See farther, _orat_. 24. _de pop. statu_.

All this, by the by, is a mark of a very iniquitous judicature: And yet the _Athenians_ valu'd themselves on having the most legal and regular administration of any people in _Greece_.

92. The authorities cited above, are all historians, orators, and philosophers, whose testimony is unquestioned. 'Tis dangerous to rely upon writers who deal in ridicule and satyr. What will posterity, for instance, infer from this passage of Dr _Swift_? "I told him, that in the kingdom of _Tribnia (Britain)_ by the natives call'd _Langdon, (London)_, where I had sojourn'd some time in my travels, the bulk of the people consist, in a manner, wholly of discoverers, witnesses, informers, accusers, prosecutors, evidences, swearers, together with their several subservient and subaltern instruments, all under the colours, the conduct, and pay of ministers of state and their deputies. The plots in that kingdom are usually the workmanship of those persons, _&c_." _Gulliver's travels_. Such a representation might suit the government of _Athens_; but not that of _England_, which is a prodigy, even in modern times, for humanity, justice, and liberty. Yet the Doctor's satyr, tho' carry'd to extremes, as is usual with him, even beyond other satyrical writers, did not altogether want an object. The Bishop of _Rochester_, who was his friend, and of the same party, had been banish'd a little before by a bill of attainder, with great justice, but without such a proof as was legal, or according to the strict forms of common law.

115. In general, there is more candour and sincerity in antient historians, but less exactness and care, than in the moderns. Our speculative factions, especially those of religion, throw such an illusion over our minds, that men seem to regard impartiality to their adversaries and to heretics, as a vice or weakness: But the commonness of books, by means of printing, has oblig'd modern historians to be more careful in avoiding contradictions and incongruities. _Diodorus Siculus_ is a good writer; but 'tis with pain I see his narration contradict, in so many particulars, the two most authentic pieces of all _Greek_ history, _viz. Xenophon_'s expedition, and _Demosthenes_'s orations. _Plutarch_ and _Appian_ seem scarce ever to have read _Cicero_'s epistles.

133. It appears, that _Cromwell_'s parliament in 1656 settled but 1,300,000 pound a year on him for the constant charges of government in all the three kingdoms. See _Scobel_, chap. 31. This was to supply fleet, army, and civil list. It appears from _Whitlocke_, that, in the year 1649, the sum of 80,000 pounds a-month was the estimate for 40,000 men. We must conclude, therefore, that _Cromwel_ had much less than that number upon pay in 1656. In the very instrument of government, 20,000 foot and 10,000 horse are fix'd by _Cromwel_ himself, and afterwards confirm'd by the parliament, as the regular standing army of the commonwealth. That number, indeed, seems not to have been much exceeded, during the whole time of the protectorship. See farther _Thurloe_, vol. 2. p. 413. 499. 568. We may there see, that tho' the Protector had more considerable armies in _Ireland_ and _Scotland_, he had not sometimes more than 4 or 5000 men in _England_.

We are to observe, that when _Dionsius Halicarnassaeus_ says, that if we regard the antient walls of _Rome_, the extent of the city will not appear greater than that of _Athens_; he must mean the _Acropolis_, and high town, only. No antient author ever speaks of the _Piraeum, Phalerus_, and _Munychia_ as the same with _Athens_. Much less can it be suppos'd, that _Dionysius_ wou'd consider the matter in that light, after the walls of _Cimon_ and _Pericles_ were destroy'd, and _Athens_ was entirely separated from these other towns. This observation destroys all _Vossius_'s reasonings, and introduces common sense into these calculations.

And this was the greatest part of their importation. This by the by is a strong proof, that there is some great mistake in the foregoing passage of _Athenaeus_. For _Attica_ itself was so barren in corn, that it produc'd not enough even to maintain the peasants. _Tit. Livii_ lib. 43. cap. 6. _Lucian_, in his _navigium sive vota_, says, that a ship, which, by the dimensions he gives, seems to have been about the size of our third rates, carry'd as much corn as wou'd maintain all _Attica_ for a twelvemonth. But perhaps _Athens_ was decay'd at that time; and besides, it is not safe to trust such loose rhetorical calculations.

171. _Diod. Sic_. lib. 17. When _Alexander_ attack'd _Thebes_, we may safely conclude, that almost the whole inhabitants were present. Whoever is acquainted with the spirit of the _Greeks_, especially of the _Thebans_, will never suspect, that any of them would desert their country, when it was reduc'd to such extreme peril and distress. As _Alexander_ took the town by assault, all those who bore arms, were put to the sword without mercy; and they amounted only to 6000 men. Among these were some strangers and manumitted slaves. The captives, consisting of old men, women, children, and slaves, were sold, and they amounted to 30,000. We may further conclude, that the free citizens in _Thebes_, of all sexes and ages, were near 24,000; the strangers and slaves about 12,000. These last were therefore somewhat fewer in proportion than at _Athens_; as is reasonable to imagine from this circumstance, that _Athens_ was a town of more trade to support slaves, and of more entertainment to allure strangers. It is also to be remark'd, that thirty-six thousand was the whole number of people, both in the city of _Thebes_ and the neighbouring territory: A very moderate number, it must be confess'd; and being founded on facts which appear undisputable, must have great weight in the present controversy. The above-mention'd number of _Rhodians_ too were the whole inhabitants of the island, who were free, and able to bear arms.

191. _Strabo_ lib. 5. says, that the Emperor _Augustus_ prohibited the raising houses higher than seventy foot. In another passage, _lib_. 16. he speaks of the houses of _Rome_ as remarkably high. See also to the same purpose _Vitruvius_, lib. 2. cap. 8. _Aristides_ the sophist, in his oration $$[greek text]$$, says, that _Rome_ consisted of cities on the top of cities; and that if one were to spread it out, and unfold it, it would cover the whole surface of _Italy_. Where an author indulges himself in such extravagant declamations, and gives so much into the hyperbolical style, one knows not how far he must be reduc'd. But this reasoning seems natural: If _Rome_ was built in so scatter'd a manner as _Dionysius_ says, and ran so much into the country, there must have been very few streets where the houses were rais'd so high. 'Tis only for want of ground, that any body builds in that inconvenient manner.

Quo si quis altitudinem tectorum addat, dignam profecto, aestimationem concipiat, fateaturque nullius urbis magnitudinem in toto orbe potuisse ei comparari. Plin. lib_. 3. _cap_. 5.

All the best manuscripts of _Pliny_ read the passage as here cited, and fix the compass of the walls of _Rome_ to be thirteen miles. The only question is, What _Pliny_ means by 30,775 paces, and how that number was form'd? The manner in which I conceive it, is this. _Rome_ was a semicircular area of thirteen miles circumference. The _Forum_, and consequently the _Milliarium_, we know, was situated on the banks of the _Tyber_, and near the center of the circle, or upon the diameter of the semicircular area. Tho' there were thirty-seven gates to _Rome_, yet only twelve of them had straight streets, leading from them to the _Milliarium_. _Pliny_, therefore, having assign'd the circumference of _Rome_, and knowing that that alone was not sufficient to give us a just notion of its surface, uses this farther method. He supposes all the streets, leading from the _Milliarium_ to the twelve gates, to be laid together into one straight line, and supposes we run along that line, so as to count each gate once: In which case, he says, that the whole line is 30,775 paces: Or, in other words, that each street or radius of the semicircular area is upon an average two miles and a half; and the whole length of _Rome_ is five miles, and its breadth about half as much, besides the scatter'd suburbs.

_Pere Hardouin_ understands this passage in the same manner; with regard to the laying together the several streets of _Rome_ into one line, in order to compose 30,775 paces: But then he supposes, that streets led from the _Milliarium_ to every gate, and that no street exceeded 800 paces in length. But (1.) a semicircular area, whose radius was only 800 paces, could never have a circumference near 13 miles, the compass of _Rome_ as assign'd by _Pliny_. A radius of two miles and a half forms very nearly that circumference. (2.) There is an absurdity in supposing a city so built as to have streets running to its center from every gate in its circumference. These streets must interfere as they approach. (3.) This diminishes too much from the greatness of antient _Rome_, and reduces that city below even _Bristol_ or _Rotterdam_.

The sense which _Vossius_ in his _Observationes variae_ puts on this passage of _Pliny_, errs widely in the other extreme. One manuscript, of no authority, instead of thirteen miles, has assign'd thirty miles for the compass of the walls of _Rome_. And _Vossius_ understands this only of the curvilinear part of the circumference; supposing, that as the _Tyber_ form'd the diameter, there were no walls built on that side. But (1.) this reading is allow'd contrary to almost all the manuscripts. (2.) Why should _Pliny_, a concise writer, repeat the compass of the walls of _Rome_ in two successive sentences? (3.) Why repeat it with so sensible a variation? (4.) What is the meaning of _Pliny_'s mentioning twice the _Milliarium_, if a line was measur'd that had no dependence on the _Milliarium_? (5.) _Aurelian_'s wall is said by _Vopiscus_ to have been drawn _laxiore ambitu_, and to have comprehended all the buildings and suburbs on the north side of the _Tyber_; yet its compass was only fifty miles; and even here critics suspect some mistake or corruption in the text. It is not probable, that _Rome_ would diminish from _Augustus_ to _Aurelian_. It remain'd still the capital of the same empire; and none of the civil wars, in that long period, except the tumults on the death of _Maiximus_ and _Balbinus_, ever affected the city. _Caracalla_ is said by _Aurelius Victor_ to have increas'd _Rome_. (6.) There are no remains of antient buildings, which mark any such greatness of _Rome_. _Vossius's reply to this objection seems absurd, That the rubbish wou'd sink 60 or 70 foot below ground. It appears from /Spartian_ (_in vita Severi_) that the five-mile stone _in via Lavicana_ was out of the city. (7.) _Olympiodorus_ and _Publius Victor_ fix the number of houses in _Rome_ to be betwixt forty and fifty thousand. (8.) The very extravagance of the consequences drawn by this critic, as well as _Lipsius_, if they be necessary, destroys the foundation on which they are grounded; That _Rome_ contain'd fourteen millions of inhabitants; while the whole kingdom of _France_ contains only five, according to his computation, _&c_.

The only objection to the sense which we have affix'd above to the passage of _Pliny_, seems to lie in this, That _Pliny_, after mentioning the thirty-seven gates of _Rome_, assigns only a reason for suppressing the seven old ones, and says nothing of the eighteen gates, the streets leading from which terminated, according to my opinion, before they reach'd the _Forum_. But as _Pliny_ was writing to the _Romans_, who perfectly knew the disposition of the streets, it is not strange he should take a circumstance for granted, which was so familiar to every body. Perhaps, too, many of these gates led to wharfs upon the river.

Notwithstanding this bulk of _Alexandria_, which seems but moderate, _Diodorus Siculus_, speaking of its circuit as drawn by _Alexander_ (which it never exceeded, as we learn from _Ammianus Marcellinus_, lib. 22. cap. 16.) says it was $$[greek text]$$, _extremely great, ibid_. The reason which he assigns for its surpassing all cities of the world (for he excepts not _Rome_) is, that it contain'd 300,000 free inhabitants. He also mentions the revenues of the kings, _viz_. 6000 talents, as another circumstance to the same purpose: No such mighty sum in our eyes, even tho' we make allowances for the different value of money. What _Strabo_ says of the neighbouring country, means only that it was well peopled, $$[greek text]$$. Might not one affirm, without any great hyperbole, that the whole banks of the river from _Gravesend_ to _Windsor_ are one city? This is even more than _Strabo_ says of the banks of the lake _Mareotis_, and of the canal to _Canopus_. 'Tis a vulgar saying in _Italy_, that the king of _Sardinia_ has but one town in _Piedmont_; for it is all a town. _Agrippa_ in _Josephus de bello Judaic_. lib. 2. cap. 16. to make his audience comprehend the excessive greatness of _Alexandria_, which he endeavours to magnify, describes only the compass of the city as drawn by _Alexander_: A clear proof that the bulk of the inhabitants were lodg'd there, and that the neighbouring country was no more than what might be expected about all great towns, very well cultivated, and well peopled.

208. Lib. 4. cap. 1. $$[greek text]$$. _Politian_ interprets it _aedibus majoribus etiam reliqua urbe_.

209. He says (in _Nerone_, cap. 30.) that a portico or piazza of it was 3000 feet long; _tanta laxitas ut porticus triplices milliarias haberet_. He cannot mean three miles. For the whole extent of the house from the _Palatine_ to the _Esquiline_ was not near so great. So when _Vopisc. in Aureliano_ mentions a portico in _Sallust_'s gardens, which he calls _porticus milliarensis_, it must be understood of a thousand feet. So also _Horace_;

/Nulla decempedis

Metata privatis opacam

Porticus excipiebat Arcton\. Lib. 2. ode 15.

So also in lib. 1. satyr. 8.

/Mille pedes in fronte, trecentos cippus in agrum

The warm southern colonies also become more healthful: And 'tis remarkable, that in the _Spanish_ histories of the first discovery and conquest of these countries, they appear to have been very healthful; being then well peopl'd and cultivated. No account of the sickness or decay of _Cortes_'s or _Pizzarro_'s small armies.

244. IT appears from _Caesar_'s account, that the _Gauls_ had no domestic slaves, who form'd a different order from the _Plebes_. The whole common people were indeed a kind of slaves to the nobility, as the people of _Poland_ are at this day: And a nobleman of _Gaul_ had sometimes ten thousand dependants of this kind. Nor can we doubt, that the armies were compos'd of the people, as well as of the nobility: An army of 100,000 noblemen from a very small state is incredible. The fighting men amongst the _Helvetii_ were the fourth part of the whole inhabitants; a clear proof, that all the males of military age bore arms. See _Caesar de bello Gall_. lib. 1.

We may remark, that the numbers in _Caesar_'s commentaries can be more depended on than those of any other antient author; because of the _Greek_ translation, which still remains, and which checks the _Latin_ original.

De harusp. resp_. cap. 9. The disorders of _Spain_ seem to have been almost proverbial: _Nec impacatos a tergo horrebis Iberos. Virg. Georg_. lib. 3. The _Iberi_ are here plainly taken, by a poetical figure, for robbers in general.

254. Tho' the observations of _L'Abbe du Bos_ shou'd be admitted, that _Italy_ is now warmer than in former times, the consequence may not be necessary, that it is more populous or better cultivated. If the other countries of _Eurpoe_ were more savage and woody, the cold winds that blow'd from them, might affect the climate of _Italy_.

255. The inhabitants of _Marseilles_ lost not their superiority over the _Gauls_ in commerce and the mechanic arts, till the _Roman_ dominion turn'd the latter from arms to agriculture and civil life. See _Strabo_, lib. 4. That author, in several places, repeats the observation concerning the improvement, arising from the _Roman_ arts and civility: And he liv'd at the time when the change was new, and would be more sensible. So also _Pliny: Quis enim non, communicato orbe terrarum, majestate Romani imperii, profecisse vitam putet, commercio rerum ac societate festae pacis, omniaque etiam, quae occulta antea fuerant, in promiscuo usu facta_. Lb. 14. proaem. _Numine deum electa_ (speaking of _Italy) /quae coelum ipsum clarius faceret, sparsa congregaret imperia, ritusque molliret, et tot populorum discordes, ferasque linguas sermonis commercio contraheret ad colloquia, et humanitatem homini daret; breviterque, una cunctarum gentium in toto orbe patria fieret_; lib. 2. cap. 5. Nothing can be stronger to this purpose than the following passage from _Tertullian_, who liv'd about the age of _Severus. Certe quidem ipse orbis in promptu est, cultior de die et instructior pristino. Omnia jam pervia, omnia nota, omnia negotiosa. Solitudines famosas retro fundi amoenissimi obliteraverunt, silvas arva domuerunt, feras pecora fugaverunt; arenae seruntur, saxa panguntur, paludes eliquantur, tantae urbes, quantae non casae quondam. Jam nec insulae horrent, nec scopuli terrent; ubique domus, ubique populus, ubique respublica, ubique vita. Summum testimonium frequentiae humanae, onerosi sumus mundo, vix nobis elementa sufficiunt; et necessitates arctiores, & quaerelae apud omnes, dum jam nos natura non sustinet. De anima_, cap. 30. The air of rhetoric and declamation which appears in this passage, diminishes somewhat from its authority, but does not intirely destroy it. The same remark may be extended to the following passage of _Aristides_ the sophist, who liv'd in the age of _Adrian. The whole world_, says he, addressing himself to the _Romans, seems to keep one holiday; and mankind, laying aside the swords which they formerly wore, now betake themselves to feasting and to joy. The cities, forgetting their antient contentions, preserve only one emulation, which shall embellish itself most by every art and ornament? Theatres every where arise, amphitheatres, porticoes, aqueducts, temples, schools, academies; and one may safely pronounce, that the sinking world has been again rais'd by your auspicious empire. Nor have cities alone receiv'd an encrease of ornament and beauty; but the whole earth, like a garden or paradise, is cultivated and adorned: Insomuch, that such of mankind as are plac'd out of the limits of your empire (who are but few) seem to merit our sympathy and compassion_.

'Tis remarkable, that tho' _Diodorus Siculus_ makes the whole inhabitants of _AEgypt_, when conquer'd by the _Romans_, amount only to three millions; yet _Josephus de bello Jud_. lib. 2. cap. 16. says, that its inhabitants, excluding those of _Alexandria_, were seven millions and a half, in the reign of _Nero_: And he expressly says, that he drew this account from the books of the _Roman_ publicans, who levy'd the poll-tax. _Strabo_, lib. 17. praises the superior police of the _Romans_ with regard to the finances of _AEgypt_, above that of its former monarchs: And no part of administration is more essential to the happiness of a people. Yet we read in _Athenaeus_, (lib. 1. cap. 25.) who flourish'd during the reign of the _Antonines_, that the town _Mareia_, near _Alexandria_, which was formerly a large city, had dwindled into a village. This is not, properly speaking, a contradiction. _Suidas_ (_August_.) says, that the emperor _Augustus_, having number'd the whole _Roman_ empire, found it contain'd only 4,101,017 men ($$[greek text]$$). There is here surely some great mistake, either in the author or transcriber. But this authority, feeble as it is, may be sufficient to counterbalance the exaggerated accounts of _Herodotus_ and _Diodorus Siculus_ with regard to more early times.

258. Lib. 2. cap. 62. It may perhaps be imagin'd, that _Polybius_, being dependent on _Rome_, wou'd naturally extol the _Roman_ dominion. But, in the _first_ place, _Polybius_, tho' one sees sometimes instances of his caution, discovers no symptoms of flattery. _Secondly_, This opinion is only deliver'd in a single stroke, by the bye, while he is intent upon another subject; and 'tis allow'd, if there be any suspicion of an author's insincerity, that these oblique propositions discover his real opinion better than his more formal and direct assertions.

263. I must confess, that that discourse of _Plutarch_, concerning the silence of the oracles, is in general of so odd a texture, and so unlike his other productions, that one is at a loss what judgement to form of it. 'Tis wrote in dialogue, which is a method of composition that _Plutarch_ commonly little affects. The personages he introduces advance very wild, absurd, and contradictory opinions, more like the visionary systems or ravings of _Plato_ than the solid sense of _Plutarch_. There runs also thro' the whole an air of superstition and credulity, which resembles very little the spirit that appears in other philosophical compositions of that author. For 'tis remarkable, that tho' _Plutarch_ be an historian as superstitious as _Herodotus_ or _Livy_, yet there is scarcely, in all antiquity, a philosopher less superstitious, excepting _Cicero_ and _Lucian_. I must, therefore, confess, that a passage of _Plutarch_, cited from this discourse, has much less authority with me, than if it had been found in most of his other compositions.

There is only one other discourse of _Plutarch_ liable to like objections, _viz_. that _concerning those whose punishment is delay'd by the Deity_. It is also wrote in dialogue, contains like superstitious, wild visions, and seems to have been chiefly composed in rivalship to _Plato_, particularly his last book, _de republica_.

And here I cannot but observe, that Mons. _Fontenelle_, a writer eminent for candour, seems to have departed a little from his usual character, when he endeavours to throw a ridicule upon _Plutarch_ on account of passages to be met with in this dialogue concerning oracles. The absurdities here put into the mouths of the several personages are not to be ascrib'd to _Plutarch_. He makes them refute each other; and, in general, he seems to intend the ridiculing of those very opinions, which _Fontenelle_ would ridicule him for maintaining. See _Histoire des Oracles_.
