  Hume began work on his [Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion] in the 1750s.
  Because of the sensitive nature of the text, however, he did not publish it in
  his lifetime, but left instructions to his nephew to publish it after his
  death. It was printed in 1779, and this edition is naturally our copytext.
  Fortunately, however, Hume's own manuscript for the work survives. This
  manuscript was consulted in drawing up the critical text provided here.
