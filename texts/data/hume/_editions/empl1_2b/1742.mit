MOST of these ESSAYS were wrote with a View of being publish'd as WEEKLY-PAPERS, and were intended to comprehend the Designs both of the SPECTATORS and CRAFTSMEN.  But having dropt that Undertaking, partly from LAZINESS, partly from WANT OF LEISURE, and being willing to make Trial of my Talents for Writing, before I ventur'd upon any more serious Compositions, I was induced to commit these Trifles to the


iv

Judgment of the Public.  Like most new Authors, I must confess, I feel some Anxiety concerning the Success of my Work:  But one Thing makes me more secure, That the READER may condemn my abilities, but, I hope, will approve of my Moderation and Impartiality in my Method of handling POLITICAL SUBJECTS:  And as long as my Moral Character is in Safety, I can, with less Concern, abandon my Learning and Capacity to the most severe Censure and Examination.  Public Spirit, methinks, shou'd engage us to love the Public, and to bear an equal Affection to all our Country-Men; not to hate one Half of them, under Colour of loving the Whole.


v

This PARTY-RAGE I have endeavour'd to repress, as far as possible; and I hope this Design will be acceptable to the moderate of both Parties; at the same Time, that, perhaps, it may displease the Bigots of both.

THE READER must not look for any Connexion among these ESSAYS, but must consider each of them as a Work apart.  This is an Indulgence that is given to all ESSAY-WRITERS; and, perhaps, such a desultory Method of Writing, is an equal Ease both to AUTHOR and READER, by freeing them from any tiresome Stretch of Attention and Application.

ESSAY I.

_Of the_ DELICACY _of_ TASTE _and_ PASSION.

THERE is a certain _Delicacy_ of _Passion_, to which some People are subject, that makes them extremely sensible to all the Accidents of Life, and gives them a lively Joy upon every prosperous Event, as well as a piercing Grief, when they meet with Crosses and Adversity.  Favours and Good-Offices easily engage their Friendship; while the smallest Injury provokes their Resentment.  Any Honour or Mark of Distinction elevates them above Measure; but they are as sensibly touch'd with Contempt.  People of this Character have, no doubt, much more lively Enjoyments, as well as more pungent Sorrows, than Men of more cool and sedate Tempers:  But, I believe, when every Thing is balanc'd, there is no one, that wou'd not rather chuse to be of the latter Character, were he entirely Master of his own Disposition.  Good or ill Fortune is very little at our own Disposal:  And when a Person, that has this Sensibility of Temper, meets with any Misfortune, his Sorrow or Resentment takes entire Possession of him, and deprives him of all Relish in the common Occurrences of Life; the right Enjoyment of which forms the greatest Part of our Happiness.  Great Pleasures are much less frequent than great Pains; so that a sensible Temper must meet with fewer Trials in the former Way than in the latter.  Not to mention, that Men of such lively Passions are apt to be transported beyond all Bounds of Prudence and Discretion, and take false Steps in the Conduct of Life, which are often irretrievable.

THERE is a _Delicacy_ of _Taste_ observable in some Men, which very much resembles this _Delicacy_ of _Passion_, and produces the same Sensibility to Beauty and Deformity of every Kind, as that does to Prosperity and Adversity, Obligations and Injuries.  When you present a Poem or a Picture to a Man possest of this Talent, the Delicacy of his Feeling, or Sentiments, makes him be touched very sensibly by every Part of it; nor are the masterly Strokes perceived with a more exquisite Relish and Satisfaction, than the Negligences or Absurdities with Disgust and Uneasiness.  A polite and judicious Conversation affords him the highest Entertainment; Rudeness or Impertinence is as great a Punishment to him.  In short, Delicacy of Taste has the same Effect as Delicacy of Passion:  It enlarges the Sphere both of our Happiness and Misery, and makes us sensible of Pains, as well as Pleasures, that escape the rest of Mankind.

I BELIEVE, however, there is no one, who will not agree with me, that notwithstanding this Resemblance, a Delicacy of Taste is as much to be desir'd and cultivated as a Delicacy of Passion is to be lamented, and to be remedied, if possible.  The good or ill Accidents of Life are very little at our Disposal; But we are pretty much Masters what Books we shall read, what Diversions we shall partake of, and what Company we shall keep.  The ancient Philosophers endeavour'd to render Happiness entirely independent of every Thing external.  That is impossible to be _attain'd_:  But every wise Man will endeavour to place his Happiness on such Objects as depend most upon himself:  And _that_ is not to be _attain'd_ so much by any other Means as by this Delicacy of Sentiment.  When a Man is possest of that Talent, he is more happy by what pleases his Taste, than by what gratifies his Appetites, and receives more Enjoyment from a Poem or a Piece of Reasoning than the most expensive Luxury can afford.

HOW far the Delicacy of Taste, and that of Passion, are connected together in the original Frame of the Mind, it is hard to determine.  To me there appears to be a very considerable Connexion betwixt them:  For we may observe, that Women, who have more delicate Passions than Men, have also a more delicate Taste of the Ornaments of Life, of Dress, Equipage, and the ordinary Decencies of Behaviour.  Any Excellency in these hits their Taste much sooner than ours; and when you please their Taste, you soon engage their Affections. BUT whatever Connexion there may be originally betwixt these Dispositions, I am persuaded, that nothing is so proper to cure us of this Delicacy of Passion, as the cultivating of that higher and more refined Taste, which enables us to judge of the Characters of Men, of Compositions of Genius, and of the Productions of the nobler Arts.  A greater or less Relish of those obvious Beauties that strike the Senses, depends entirely upon the greater or less Sensibility of the Temper:  But, with regard to the Liberal Arts and the Sciences, a fine Taste is really nothing but strong Sense, or at least depends so much upon it, that they are inseparable.  To judge aright of a Composition of Genius, there are so many Views to be taken in, so many Circumstances to be compared, and such a Knowledge of human Nature requisite, that no Man, who is not possest of the soundest Judgment, will ever make a tolerable Critic in such Performances.  And this is a new Reason for cultivating a Relish in the Liberal Arts.  Our Judgment will strengthen by this Exercise:  We shall form truer Notions of Life:  Many Things, which rejoice or afflict others, will appear to us too frivolous to engage our Attention:  And we shall lose by Degrees that Sensibility and Delicacy of Passion, which is so incommodious.

BUT perhaps I have gone too far in saying, That a cultivated Taste for the polite Arts extinguishes the Passions, and renders us indifferent to those Objects which are so fondly pursued by the rest of Mankind.  When I reflect a little more, I find, that it rather improves our Sensibility for all the tender and agreeable Passions; at the same Time that it renders the Mind incapable of the rougher and more boist'rous Emotions.

/Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes,

Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros\.

FOR this, I think there may be assign'd two very natural Reasons.  In the _first_ Place, nothing is so improving to the Temper as the Study of the Beauties, either of Poetry, Eloquence, Musick, or Painting.  They give a certain  Elegance of Sentiment, which the rest of Mankind are entire Strangers to.  The Emotions they excite are soft and tender.  They draw the Mind off from the Hurry of Business and Interest; cherish Reflection; dispose to Tranquility; and produce an agreeable Melancholy, which, of all Dispositions of the Mind, is the best suited to Love and Friendship.

IN the _second_ Place, a Delicacy of Taste is favourable to Love and Friendship, by confining our Choice to few People, and making us indifferent to the Company and Conversation of the greatest Part of Men.  You will very seldom find, that mere Men of the World, whatever strong Sense they may be endowed with, are very nice in distinguishing of Characters, or in marking those insensible Differences and Gradations which make one Man preferable to another:  Any one, that has competent Sense, is sufficient for their Entertainment:  They talk to him, of their Pleasures and Affairs, with the same Frankness as they would to any other:  And finding many, that are fit to supply his Place, they never feel any Vacancy or Want in his Absence.  But to make Use of the Allusion of a famous <1> _French_ Author, the Judgment may be compared to a Clock or Watch, where the most ordinary Machine is sufficient to tell the Hours; but the most elaborate and artificial only can point  out the Minutes and Seconds, and distinguish the smallest Differences of Time.  One that has well digested his Knowledge both of Books and Men, has little Enjoyment but in the Company of a few select Companions.  He feels too sensibly, how much all the rest of Mankind fall short of the Notions he has entertained.  And, his Affections being thus confined in a narrow Circle, no Wonder he carries them further than if they were more general and undistinguished.  The Gaiety and Frolick of a Bottle-Companion improves with him into a solid Friendship:  And the Ardours of a youthful Appetite become an elegant Passion.

ESSAY II.

_Of the_ LIBERTY _of the_ PRESS.

THERE is nothing more apt to surprise a Foreigner, than the extreme Liberty we enjoy in this Country, of communicating whatever we please to the Publick, and of openly censuring every Measure which is enter'd into by the King or his Ministers.  If the Administration resolve upon War, 'tis affirm'd, that either wilfully or ignorantly they mistake the Interest of the Nation, and that Peace, in the present Situation of Affairs, is infinitely preferable.  If the Passion of the Ministers be for Peace, our Political Writers breathe nothing but War and Devastation, and represent the pacifick Conduct of the Government as mean and pusillanimous.  As this Liberty is not indulg'd in any other Government, either Republican or Monarchical; in _Holland_ and _Venice_, no more than in _France_ or _Spain_; it may very naturally give Occasion to these two Questions, _How it happens that_ Great Britain _enjoys such a peculiar Privilege_? and, _Whether the unlimited Exercise of this Liberty be advantageous or prejudicial to the Publick_?

AS to the _first_ Question, Why the Laws indulge us in such an extraordinary Liberty?  I believe the Reason may be deriv'd from our mixt Form of Government, which is neither wholly Monarchical, nor wholly Republican.  'Twill be found, if I mistake not, to be a true Observation in Politicks, That the two Extremes in Government, of Liberty and Slavery, approach nearest to each other; and, that as you depart from the  Extremes, and mix a little of Monarchy with Liberty, the Government becomes always the more free; and, on the other Hand, when you mix a little of Liberty with Monarchy, the Yoke becomes always the more grievous and intolerable.  In a Government, such as that of _France_, which is entirely absolute, and where Laws, Custom, and Religion, all concur to make the People fully satisfi'd with their Condition, the Monarch cannot entertain the least _Jealousy_ against his Subjects, and therefore is apt to indulge them in great _Liberties_ both of Speech and Action.  In a Government altogether Republican, such as _Holland_, where there is no Magistrate so eminent as to give _Jealousy_ to the State, there is also no Danger in intrusting the Magistrates with very large discretionary Powers; and tho' many Advantages result from such Powers, in the Preservation of Peace and Order; yet they lay a considerable Restraint on Mens Actions, and make every private Subject pay a great Respect to the Government.  Thus it is evident, that the two Extremes, of absolute Monarchy and of a Republic, approach very near to each other in the most material Circumstances.  In the _first_, the Magistrate has no Jealousy of the People:  In the _second_, the People have no Jealousy of the Magistrate:  Which want of Jealousy begets a mutual Confidence and Trust in both Cases, and produces a Species of Liberty in Monarchies, and of arbitrary Power in Republics.

TO justify the other Part of the foregoing Observation, that in every Government the Means are most wide of each other, and that the Mixtures of Monarchy and Liberty render the Yoke either more easy or more grievous; I must take Notice of a Remark of _Tacitus_ with regard to the _Romans_ under their Emperors, that they neither could bear total Slavery nor total Liberty, _Nec totam servitutem, nec totam libertatem pati possunt_.  This Remark a famous Poet has translated and applied to the _English_, in his admirable Description of Queen _Elizabeth's_ Policy and happy Government.

/Et fit aimer son joug a l'Anglois indompte,

Qui ne peut ni servir, ni vivre en liberte\.

HENRIADE, _Liv_. I.

ACCORDING to these Remarks, therefore, we are to consider the _Roman_ Government as a Mixture of Despotism and Liberty, where the Despotism prevailed; and the _English_ Government as a Mixture of the same Kind, but where the Liberty predominates.  The Consequences are exactly conformable to the foregoing Observation; and such as may be expected from those mixed Forms of Government, which beget a mutual Watchfulness and Jealousy.  The _Roman_ Emperors were, many of them, the most frightful Tyrants that ever disgraced Humanity; and 'tis evident their Cruelty was chiefly excited by their _Jealousy_, and by their observing, that all the great Men of _Rome_ bore with Impatience the Dominion of a Family, which, but a little before, was noways superior to their own.  On the other Hand, as the Republican Part of the Government prevails in _England_, tho' with a great Mixture of Monarchy, 'tis obliged, for its own Preservation, to maintain a watchful _Jealousy_ over the Magistrates, to remove all discretionary Powers, and to secure every one's Life and Fortune by general and inflexible Laws.  No Action must be deemed a Crime but what the Law has plainly determined to be such:  No Crime must be imputed to a Man but from a legal Proof before his Judges:  And even these Judges must be his Fellow-Subjects, who are obliged, by their own Interest, to have a watchful Eye over the Encroachments and Violence of the Ministers.  From these Causes it proceeds, that there is as much Liberty, and even, perhaps, Licentiousness in _Britain_, as there were formerly Slavery and Tyranny in _Rome_. THESE Principles account for the great Liberty of the Press in these Kingdoms, beyond what is indulg'd in any other Government.  'Tis sufficiently known, that despotic Power wou'd soon steal in upon us, were we not extreme watchful to prevent its Progress, and were there not an easy Method of conveying the Alarum from one End of the Kingdom to the other.  The Spirit of the People must frequently be rouz'd to curb the Ambition of the Court; and the Dread of rouzing this Spirit must be employ'd to prevent that Ambition.  Nothing is so effectual to this Purpose as the Liberty of the Press, by which all the Learning, Wit, and Genius of the Nation may be employ'd on the Side of Liberty, and every one be animated to its Defence.  As long, therefore, as the Republican Part of our Government can maintain itself against the Monarchical, it must be extreme jealous of the Liberty of the Press, as of the utmost Importance to its Preservation.

SINCE therefore the Liberty of the Press is so essential to the Support of our mixt Government; this sufficiently decides the second Question, _Whether this Liberty be advantageous or prejudicial_; there being nothing of greater Importance in every State than the Preservation of the ancient Government, especially if it be a free one.  But I wou'd fain go a Step farther, and assert, that such a Liberty is attended with so few Inconveniencies, that it may be claim'd as the common Right of Mankind, and ought to be indulg'd them almost in every Government; except the Ecclesiastical, to which indeed it wou'd be fatal.  We need not dread from this Liberty any such ill Consequences as follow'd from the Harangues of the popular Demagogues of _Athens_ and Tribunes of _Rome_.  A Man reads a Book or Pamphlet alone and coolly.  There is none present from whom he can catch the Passion by Contagion.  He is not hurry'd away by the Force and Energy of Action.  And shou'd he be wrought up to never so seditious a Humour, there is no violent Resolution presented to him, by which he can immediately vent his Passion.  The Liberty of the Press, therefore, however abus'd, can scarce ever excite popular Tumults or Rebellion.  And as to those Murmurs or secret Discontents it may occasion, 'tis better they shou'd get Vent in Words, that they may come to the Knowledge of the Magistrate before it be too late, in order to his providing a Remedy against them.  Mankind, 'tis true, have always a greater Propension to believe what is said to the Disadvantage of their Governors, than the contrary; but this Inclination is inseparable from them, whether they have Liberty or not.  A Whisper may fly as quick, and be as pernicious as a Pamphlet.  Nay, it will be more pernicious, where Men are not accustom'd to think freely, or distinguish betwixt Truth and Falshood.

IT has also been found, as the Experience of Mankind increases, that the _People_ are no such dangerous Monster as they have been represented, and that 'tis in every Respect better to guide them, like rational Creatures, than to lead or drive them, like brute Beasts.  Before the united Provinces set the Example, Toleration was deem'd incompatible with good Government, and 'twas thought impossible, that a Number of religious Sects cou'd live together in Harmony and Peace, and have all of them an equal Affection to their common Country, and to each other.  _England_ has set a like Example of civil Liberty; and tho' this Liberty seems to occasion some small Ferment at present, it has not as yet produced any pernicious Effects; and it is to be hoped, that Men, being every Day more accustomed to the free Discussion of public Affairs, will improve in their Judgment of them, and be with greater Difficulty seduced by every idle Rumour and popular Clamour.

'TIS a very comfortable Reflection to the Lovers of Liberty, that this peculiar Privilege of _Britain_ is of a Kind that cannot easily be wrested from us, but must last as long as our Government remains, in any Degree, free and independent.  'Tis seldom, that Liberty of any Kind is lost all at once.  Slavery has so frightful an Aspect to Men accustom'd to Freedom, that it must steal in upon them by Degrees, and must disguise itself in a thousand Shapes, in order to be received.  But, if the Liberty of the Press ever be lost, it must be lost at once.  The general Laws against Sedition and Libelling are at present as strong as they possibly can be made.  Nothing can impose a farther Restraint, but either the clapping an IMPRIMATUR upon the Press, or the giving very large discretionary Powers to the Court to punish whatever displeases them.  But these Concessions would be such a bare-fac'd Violation of Liberty, that they will probably be the last Efforts of a despotic Government.  We may conclude, that the Liberty of _Britain_ is gone for ever, when these Attempts shall succeed.

ESSAY IV.

_That_ POLITICS /may be reduc'd

to a\ SCIENCE.

IT is a great Question with several, Whether there be any essential Difference betwixt one Form of Government and another? and, Whether every Form may not become good or bad, according as it is well or ill administred <1>?  Were it once admitted, that all Governments are alike, and that the only Difference consists in the Character and Conduct of the Governors, most political Disputes wou'd be at an End, and all _Zeal_ for one Constitution above another must be esteem'd mere Bigotry and Folly.  But though I be a profest  Friend to _Moderation_, I cannot forbear condemning this Sentiment, and should be sorry to think, that human Affairs admit of no greater Stability, than what they receive from the casual Humours and Characters of particular Men.

'TIS true, those who maintain, that the Goodness of all Government consists in the Goodness of the Administration, may cite many particular Instances in History where the very same Government, in different Hands, varies suddenly into the two opposite Extremes of good and bad.  Compare the _French_  Government under _Henry_ III. and under _Henry_ IV.  Cruelty, Oppression, Levity, Artifice on the Part of the Rulers; Faction, Sedition, Treachery, Rebellion, Disloyalty on the Part of the Subjects:  These compose the Character of the former miserable AEra.  But when the Patriot and heroic Prince, who succeeded, was once firmly seated on the Throne, the Government, the People, every Thing seem'd to be totally chang'd, and all from the Change of the Temper and Sentiments of one single Man.  An equal Difference of a contrary Kind, may be found in comparing the Reigns of  _Elisabeth_ and _James_, at least with Regard to foreign Affairs; and Instances of this Kind may be multiply'd, almost without Number, from antient as well as modern History.

BUT here I wou'd beg Leave to make a Distinction.  All absolute Governments (and such the _English_ Government was, in a great Measure, till the Middle of the last Century, notwithstanding of the numerous Panegyrics on the antient _English_ Liberty) must very much depend on the Administration; and this is one of the great Inconveniences of that Form of Government.  But a Republican and free Government wou'd be a most glaring Absurdity, if the particular Checks and Controuls, provided by the Constitution, had really no Influence, and made it not the Interest, even of bad Men, to operate for the public Good.  Such is the Intention of these Forms of Government, and such is their real Effect, where they are wisely constituted: As, on the other Hand, they are the Sources of all Disorder, and of the blackest Crimes, where either Skill or Honesty has been wanting in their original Frame and Institution.  SO great is the Force of Laws, and of particular Forms of Government, and so little Dependence have they on the Humours and Temper of Men, that Consequences as general and as certain may be deduced from them, on most Occasions, as any which the Mathematical Sciences can afford us.

THE _Roman_ Government gave the whole Legislative Power to the Commons, without allowing a Negative, either to the Nobility, or Consuls. This unbounded Power the Commons possessed in a collective Body, not in a Representative.  The Consequences were, When the People, by Success and Conquest, had become very numerous, and had spread themselves to a great Distance from the Capital, the City-Tribes, tho' the most contemptible, carried almost every Vote:  They were, therefore, most cajol'd by every one who affected Popularity:  They were supported in Idleness by the general Distribution of Corn, and by particular Bribes, which they received from almost every Candidate:  By this Means they became every Day more licentious, and the _Campus Martius_ was a perpetual Scene of Tumult and Sedition:  Armed Slaves were  introduced among these rascally Citizens; so that the whole Government fell into Anarchy, and the greatest Happiness the _Romans_ could look for, was the despotick Power of the _Caesars_.  Such are the Effects of Democracy without a Representative.

A NOBILITY may possess the whole, or any Part of the legislative, Power of a State, after two different Ways.  Either every Nobleman shares the Power as Part of the whole Body, or the whole Body enjoys the Power as composed of Parts, which have each a distinct Power and Authority.  The _Venetian_ Nobility are an Instance of the first Kind of Government:  The _Polish_ of the second.  In the _Venetian_ Government the whole Body of Nobility possesses the whole Power, and no Nobleman has any Authority, which he receives not from the Whole.  In the _Polish_ Government every Nobleman, by Means of his Fiefs, has a peculiar hereditary Authority over his Vassals, and the whole Body has no Authority but what it receives from the Concurrence of its Parts.  The distinct Operations and Tendencies of these two Species of Government might be made most apparent even  _a priori_.  A _Venetian_ Nobility is infinitely preferable to a _Polish_, let the Humours and Education of Men be ever so much vary'd.  A Nobility, who possess their Power in common, will preserve Peace and Order, both among themselves, and their Subjects; and no Member can have Authority enough to controul the Laws for a Moment.  They will preserve their Authority over the People, but without any grievous Tyranny, or any Breach of private Property; because such a tyrannical Government is not the Interest of the whole Body, however it may be the Interest of some Individuals.  There will be a Distinction of Rank betwixt the Nobility and People, but this will be the only Distinction in the State.  The whole Nobility will form one Body, and the whole People another, without any of those private Feuds and Animosities, which spread Ruin and Desolation everywhere.  'Tis easy to see the Disadvantages of a _Polish_ Nobility in every one of these Particulars.

'TIS possible so to constitute a free Government, as that a single Person, call him Duke, Prince or King, shall possess a very large Share of the Power, and shall form a proper Ballance or Counterpoise  to the other Parts of the Legislature.  This chief Magistrate may be either _elective_ or _hereditary_; and tho' the former Institution may, to a superficial View, appear most advantageous; yet a more accurate Inspection will discover in it greater Inconveniencies than in the latter, and such as are founded on Causes and Principles eternal and immutable.  The filling of the Throne, in such a Government, is a Point of too great and too general Interest, not to divide the whole People into Factions:  From whence a Civil War, the greatest of Ills, may be apprehended, almost with Certainty, upon every Vacancy.  The Prince elected must be either a _Foreigner_ or a _Native_:  The former will be ignorant of the People whom he is to govern; suspicious of his new Subjects, and suspected by them; giving his Confidence entirely to Strangers, who will have no other Thoughts but of enriching themselves in the quickest Manner, while their Master's Favour and Authority are able to support them.  A Native will carry into the Throne all his private Animosities and Friendships, and will never be regarded, in his Elevation, without exciting the Sentiments of Envy in those, who formerly  consider'd him as their Equal.  Not to mention, that a Crown is too high a Reward ever to be given to Merit alone, and will always induce the Candidates to employ Force, or Money, or Intrigue, to procure the Votes of the Electors:  So that such a Choice will give no better Chance for a superior Merit in the Prince, than if the State had trusted to Birth alone to determine their Sovereign.

IT may therefore be pronounced as an universal Axiom in Politics, _That an hereditary Prince, a Nobility without Vassals, and a People voting by their Representatives, form the best_  MONARCHY, ARISTOCRACY _and_ DEMOCRACY.  But in order to prove more fully, that Politics admit of general Truths, which are invariable by the Humour or Education either of Subject or Sovereign, it may not be amiss to observe some other Principles of this Science, which may seem to deserve that Character.

IT may easily be observ'd, that though free Governments have been commonly the most happy for those who partake of their Freedom; yet are they the most ruinous and  oppressive for their Provinces:  And this Observation may, I believe, be fix'd as a Maxim of the Kind we are here speaking of.  When a Monarch extends his Dominions by Conquest, he soon learns to consider his old and his new Subjects as on the same Footing; because in Reality, all his Subjects are to him the same, except the few Friends and Favourites with whom he is personally acquainted.  He does not, therefore, make any Distinction betwixt them in his _general_ Laws; and, at the same Time, is no less careful to prevent all _particular_ Acts of Oppression on the one as on the other:  But a free State necessarily makes a great Distinction, and must always do so, 'till Men learn to love their Neighbours as well as themselves.  The Conquerors, in such a Government, are all Legislators, and will be sure so to contrive Matters, by Restrictions of Trade and by Taxes, as to draw some private, as well as public, Advantage from their Conquests.  Provincial Governors have also a better Chance in a Republic, to escape with their Plunder, by means of Bribery or Interest; and their Fellow-Citizens, who find their own State to be inriched by the Spoils of their Subject-Provinces, will be  the more inclined to tolerate such Abuses.  Not to mention, that 'tis a necessary Precaution in a free State to change the Governors frequently; which obliges these temporary Tyrants to be more expeditious and rapacious, that they may accumulate sufficient Wealth before they give place to their Successors.  What cruel Tyrants were the _Romans_ over the World during the Time of their Common-wealth!  'Tis true, they had Laws to prevent Oppression in their Provincial Magistrates; but _Cicero_ informs us, that the _Romans_ could not better consult the Interest of the Provinces than by repealing these very Laws.  For, says he, in that Case our Magistrates, having entire Impunity, would plunder no more than would satisfy their own Rapaciousness:  Whereas, at present, they must also satisfy that of their Judges, and of all the great Men of _Rome_, whose Protection they stand in need of.  Who can read of the Cruelties and Oppressions of _Verres_ without Horror and Astonishment?  And, who is not touched with Indignation to hear, that after _Cicero_ had exhausted on that abandoned Criminal all the Thunders of the most divine Eloquence, and had prevailed so far as to get him condemned  to the utmost Extent of the Laws;  yet that cruel Tyrant lived peaceably to old Age, in Opulence and Ease, and, thirty Years afterward, was put into the Proscription by _Mark Anthony_, upon account of his exorbitant Wealth, where he fell, along with _Cicero_ himself, and all the most virtuous Men of _Rome_?  After the Dissolution of the Common-wealth, the _Roman_ Yoke became easier upon the Provinces, as _Tacitus_ informs us; and it may be observed, that many of the worst Emperors, _Domitian_, for instance, were very careful to prevent all Oppression of the Provinces.  In <2> _Tiberius_'s Time, _Gaul_  was esteemed richer than _Italy_ itself:  Nor do I find, during the whole Time of the _Roman_ Monarchy, that the Empire became less rich or populous in any of its Provinces; though indeed its Valour and military Discipline were always upon the Decline.  If we pass from ancient to modern Times, we shall find the same Observation to hold true.  The Provinces of absolute Monarchies are always  better treated than those of free States.  Compare the _Pais conquis_ of _France_ with _Ireland_, and you'll be convinc'd of this Truth; though this latter Kingdom, being almost entirely peopled from _England_, possesses so many Rights and Privileges as should naturally make it challenge better Treatment than that of a conquered Province.  _Corsica_ is also an obvious Instance to the same Purpose.

THERE is an Observation of _Machiavel_, with regard to the Conquests of _Alexander_ the _Great_, which, I think, may be regarded as one of those eternal political Truths which no Time or Accidents can vary.  It may seem strange, says that Politician, that such sudden Conquests, as those of _Alexander_, shou'd be possest so peaceably by his Successors, and that the _Persians_, during all the Confusions and Civil Wars of the _Greeks_, never made the smallest Efforts towards the Recovery of their former independent Government.  To satisfy us concerning the Cause of this remarkable Event, we may consider, that a Monarch may govern his Subjects after two different Ways.  He may either follow the Maxims of the Eastern Princes, and stretch his Power so far as  to leave no Distinction of Ranks among his Subjects, but what proceeds immediately from himself; no Advantages of Birth; no hereditary Honours and Possessions; and, in a Word, no Credit among the People, except from his Commission alone.  Or a Monarch may exert his Power in a milder Manner, like our _European_ Princes; and leave other Sources of Honour, beside his Smile and Favour:  Birth, Titles, Possessions; Valour, Integrity, Knowledge, or brave and fortunate Atchievements.  In the former Species of Government, after a Conquest, 'tis impossible ever to shake off the Yoke; since no one possesses, among the People, so much personal Credit and Authority as to begin such an Enterprize:  Whereas, in the latter Species of Government, the least Misfortune, or Discord of the Victors, will encourage the Vanquish'd to take Arms, who have Leaders ready to prompt and conduct them in every Undertaking.

SUCH is the Reasoning of _Machiavel_, which seems to me very solid and conclusive; tho' I wish he had not mixt Falshood with Truth, in asserting, that Monarchies govern'd according to the Eastern Policy, tho' more  easily kept when once they are subdued, yet are the most difficult to be subdued; since they cannot contain any powerful Subject, whose Discontent and Faction may facilitate the Enterprizes of an Enemy:  For besides, that such a tyrannical Government enervates the Courage of Men, and renders them indifferent concerning the Fortunes of their Sovereign; besides this, I say, we find, by Experience, that even the temporary and delegated Authority of the Generals and Magistrates, being always, in such Governments, as absolute within its Sphere, as that of the Prince himself, is able, with Barbarians accustom'd to a blind Submission, to produce the most dangerous and fatal Revolutions.  So that, in every Respect, a gentle Government is preferable, and gives the greatest Security to the Sovereign, as well as to the Subject.

LEGISLATORS, therefore, shou'd not trust the future Government of a State entirely to Chance, but ought to provide a System of Laws to regulate the Administration of public Affairs to the latest Posterity.  Effects will always correspond to Causes; and wise Regulations in any Common-wealth are the most  valuable Legacy, which can be left to future Ages.  In the smallest Court or Office, the stated Forms and Methods, by which Business must be conducted, are found to be a considerable Check on the natural Depravity of Mankind.  Why shou'd not the Case be the same in public Affairs?  Can we ascribe the Stability and Wisdom of the _Venetian_ Government, thro' so many Ages, to any Thing but their Form of Government?  And is it not easy to point out those Defects in the original Constitution, which produc'd the tumultuous Governments of _Athens_ and _Rome_, and ended at last in the Ruin of these two famous Republics?  And so little Dependence has this Affair on the Humours and Education of particular Men, that one Part of the same Republic may be wisely conducted, and another weakly, by the very same Men, merely on account of the Difference of the Forms and Institutions, by which these Parts are regulated.  Historians inform us, that this was actually the Case with _Genoa_.  For while the State was always full of Sedition, and Tumult, and Disorder, the Bank of St. _George_, which had become a considerable Part of the People, was conducted,  for several Ages, with the utmost Integrity and Wisdom. <3>

HERE, then, is a sufficient Inducement to maintain, with the utmost ZEAL, in every free State, those Forms and Institutions by which Liberty is secured, the Publick Good consulted, and the Avarice or Ambition of particular Men restrained and punished.  Nothing does more Honour to human Nature, than to see it susceptible of so noble a Passion; as nothing can be a greater Indication of Meanness of Heart in any Man, than to see him devoid of it.  A Man who loves only himself, without Regard to Friendship or Merit, is a detestable Monster; and a Man, who is only susceptible of Friendship, without publick Spirit, or a Regard  to the Community, is deficient in the most material Part of Virtue.

BUT this is a Subject that need not be longer insisted on at present.  There are enow of Zealots on both Sides to kindle up the Passions of their Partizans, and under the Pretence of publick Good, pursue the Interests and Ends of their particular Faction:  For my Part, I shall always be more fond of promoting Moderation than Zeal; though perhaps the surest Way of producing Moderation in every Party, is to increase our Zeal for the Publick.  Let us, therefore, try, if it be possible, from the foregoing Doctrine, to draw a Lesson of Moderation with regard to the Parties in which our Country is at present divided; at the same Time, that we allow not this Moderation to abate the Industry and Passion with which every Individual is bound to pursue the Good of his Country.

THOSE who either attack or defend a Minister in such a Government as ours, where the utmost Liberty is allowed, always carry Matters to Extremes, and exaggerate his Merit or Demerit with regard to the Publick.   His Enemies are sure to charge him with the greatest Enormities, both in domestic and foreign Management; and there is no Meanness or Crime, of which, in their Account, he is not capable.  Unnecessary Wars, scandalous Treaties, Profusion of public Treasure, oppressive Taxes, every Kind of Male-administration is ascribed to him.  To aggravate the Charge, his pernicious Conduct, it is said, will extend its baneful Influence even to Posterity, by undermining the best Constitution in the World, and disordering that wise System of Laws, Institutions and Customs, by which our Ancestors, for so many Centuries, have been so happily governed.  He is not only a wicked Minister in himself, but has removed every Security provided against wicked Ministers for the future.

ON the other Hand, the Partizans of the Minister make his Panegyric run as high as the Accusation against him, and celebrate his wise, steady, and moderate Conduct in every Part of his Administration.  The Honour and Interest of the Nation supported abroad, publick Credit maintain'd at home, Persecution restrain'd, Faction subdu'd; the Merit of all  these Blessings is ascrib'd solely to the Minister.  At the same Time, he crowns all his other Merits, by a religious Care of the best Constitution in the World, which he has preserv'd inviolate in all its Parts, and has transmitted entire, to be the Happiness and Security of the latest Posterity.

WHEN this Accusation and Panegyric are receiv'd by the Partizans of each Party, no Wonder they engender a most extraordinary Ferment on both Sides, and fill the whole Nation with the most violent Animosities.  But I wou'd fain perswade these Party-Zealots, that there is a flat Contradiction both in the Accusation and Panegyric, and that it were impossible for either of them to run so high, were it not for this Contradiction.  If our Constitution be really <4> _that noble Fabric, the Pride of_ Britain, _the Envy of our Neighbours, rais'd by the Labour of so many Centuries, repair'd at the Expence of so many Millions, and cemented by such a Profusion of Blood_; I say, if our Constitution does in any Degree deserve these Elogiums, it wou'd never have suffer'd  a wicked and a weak Minister to govern triumphantly for a Course of Twenty Years, when oppos'd by the greatest Geniuses of the Nation, who exercis'd the utmost Liberty of Tongue and Pen, in Parliament, and in their frequent Appeals to the People.  But, if the Minister be wicked and weak, to the Degree so strenuously insisted on, the Constitution must be faulty in its original Principles, and the Minister cannot consistently be charg'd with undermining the best Constitution of the World.  A Constitution is only so far good, as it provides a Remedy against Male-administration; and if the _British_ Constitution, when in its greatest Vigour, and repair'd by two such remarkable Events, as the _Revolution_ and _Accession_, by which our ancient Royal Family was sacrificed to it; if our Constitution, I say, with so great Advantages, does not, in Fact, provide any such Remedy against Male-administration, we are rather beholden to any Minister that undermines it, and affords us an Opportunity of erecting a better Constitution in its Place.

I WOU'D make Use of the same Topics to moderate the Zeal of those who defend the  Minister.  _Is our Constitution so excellent_?  Then a Change of Ministry can be no such dreadful Event; since 'tis essential to such a Constitution, in every Ministry, both to preserve itself from Violation, and to prevent all Enormities in the Administration.  _Is our Constitution very bad_?  Then so extraordinary a Jealousy and Apprehension, on Account of Changes, is ill-plac'd; and a Man shou'd no more be anxious in this Case, than a Husband, who had marry'd a Woman from the Stews, shou'd be watchful to prevent her Infidelity.  Publick Affairs, in such a Constitution, must necessarily go to Confusion, by whatever Hands they are conducted; and the Zeal of _Patriots_ is much less requisite in that Case than the Patience and Submission of _Philosophers_.  The Virtue and good Intentions of _Cato_ and _Brutus_ are highly laudable; But, to what Purpose did their Zeal serve?  To nothing, but to hasten the fatal Period of the _Roman_ Government, and render its Convulsions and dying Agonies more violent and painful.

I WOU'D not be understood to mean, that public Affairs deserve no Care and Attention at all.  Wou'd Men be moderate and consistent,  their Claims might be admitted; at least, might be examin'd.  The _Country-Party_ might still assert, that our Constitution, tho' excellent, will admit of Male-administration to a certain Degree; and therefore, if the Minister be bad, 'tis proper to oppose him with a _suitable_ Degree of Zeal.  And, on the other Side, the _Court-Party_ may be allow'd, upon the Supposition, that the Minister were good, to defend, and with _some_ Zeal too, his Administration.  I wou'd only perswade Men not to contend, as if they were fighting _pro aris & focis_, and change a good Constitution into a bad one, by the Violence of their Factions.

I HAVE not here consider'd any Thing that  is personal in the present Controversy.  In the best Constitution of the World, where every Man is restrain'd by the most rigid Laws, 'tis easy to discover either the good or bad Intentions of a Minister, and to judge, whether his personal Character deserves Love or Hatred.  But such Questions are of little Importance to the Public, and ly under a just Suspicion either of Malevolence or Flattery in those who employ their Pens upon them.

ESSAY V.

_Of the first_ PRINCIPLES _of_ GOVERNMENT.

NOTHING is more surprising to those, who consider human Affairs with a philosophical Eye, than to see the Easiness with which the many are governed by the few; and to observe the implicite Submission with which Men resign their own Sentiments and Passions to those of their Rulers.  When we enquire by what Means this Wonder is brought about, we shall find, that as FORCE is always on the Side of the Governed, the Governors have nothing to support them but OPINION.  'Tis therefore, on Opinion only that Government is founded; and this Maxim extends to the most despotick and most military Governments, as well as to the most free and most popular.  The _Soldan_ of _AEgypt_, or  the _Emperor_ of _Rome_, might drive his harmless Subjects, like brute Beasts, against their Sentiments and Inclination:  But he must, at least, have led his _Mamalukes_, or _Praetorian Bands_, like Men, by their Opinion.

OPINION is of two Kinds, _viz_. Opinion of INTEREST, and Opinion of RIGHT.  By Opinion of Interest, I chiefly understand the Sense of the public Advantage which is reapt from Government; along with the Perswasion, that the particular Government, which is establish'd, is equally advantageous with any other that cou'd easily be settled.  When this Opinion prevails among the Generality of a State, or among those who have the Force in their Hands, it gives great Security to any Government.

RIGHT is of two Kinds, Right to POWER, and Right to PROPERTY.  What Prevalence Opinion of the first Kind has over Mankind, may easily be understood by observing the Attachment which all Nations have to their ancient Government, and even to those Names which have had the Sanction of Antiquity.  Antiquity always begets the Opinion of Right;  and whatever disadvantageous Sentiment we may entertain of Mankind, they are always found to be prodigal both of Blood and Treasure in the Maintenance of public Right.  This Passion we may denominate Enthusiasm, or may give it what Appellation we please; but a Politician, who wou'd overlook its Influence on human Affairs, wou'd prove himself to have but a very limited Understanding.

'TIS sufficiently understood, that the Opinion of Right to Property is of the greatest Moment in all Matters of Government.  A noted Author has made Property the Foundation of all Government; and most of our Political Writers seem inclin'd to follow him in that Particular.  This is carrying the Matter too far; but still it must be own'd, that the Opinion of Right to Property has a great Influence in this Subject.

UPON these three Opinions, therefore, of _Interest_, of _Right to Power_, and of _Right to Property_, are all Governments founded, and all Authority of the few over the many.  There are indeed other Principles, which add Force to these, and determine, limit, or alter their  Operation; such as _Self-Interest, Fear_, and _Affection_:  But still I assert, that these other Principles can have no Influence alone, but suppose the antecedent Influence of those Opinions above-mention'd:  They are, therefore, to be esteem'd the secondary, not the original Principles of Government.

FOR, _first_, as to _Self-Interest_, by which I mean the Expectation of particular Rewards, distinct from the general Protection which we receive from Government, 'tis evident, that the Magistrate's Authority must be antecedently establish'd, or, at least be hop'd for, in order to produce this Expectation.  The Expectation of Reward may augment the Authority with regard to some particular Persons; but can never give Birth to it with regard to the Public.  Men naturally look for the greatest Favours from their Friends and Acquaintance; and therefore, the Hopes of any considerable Number of the State, wou'd never center in any particular Set of Men, if these Men had no other Title to Magistracy, and had no Influence over the Opinions of Mankind.  The same Observation may be extended to the other two Principles of _Fear_ and  _Affection_.  No Man would have any Reason to _fear_ the Fury of a Tyrant, if he had no Authority over any but from Fear; since, as a single Man, his bodily Force can reach but a small Way, and whatever Power he has beyond, must be founded either on our own Opinion, or on the presum'd Opinion of others.  And tho' _Affection_ to Wisdom and Virtue in a _Sovereign_ extends very far, and has great Influence; yet he must be antecedently suppos'd to be invested with a public Character, otherwise the public Esteem will serve him in no Stead, nor will his Virtue have any Influence beyond his private Sphere.

A GOVERNMENT may endure for several Ages, though the Ballance of Power, and the Ballance of Property do not agree.  This chiefly happens, where any Member of the state has acquired a large Share of the Property; but, from the original Constitution of the Government, has no Share of the Power.  Under what Pretext would any Individual of that Order pretend to intermeddle in public Affairs?  As Men are commonly much attach'd to their ancient Government, it is not to be expected, that the Public would ever favour  such Usurpations.  But where the original Constitution allows any Share of the Power, though small, to an Order of Men, that possesses a large Share of the Property, 'tis easy for them gradually to stretch their Authority, and bring the Ballance of Power to coincide with that of Property.  This has been the Case with the House of Commons in _England_.

MOST Writers, that have treated of the _British_ Government, have supposed, that as the House of Commons represents all the Commons of _Great Britain_; so its Weight in the Scale is proportioned to the Property and Power of all whom it represents.  But this Principle must not be received as absolutely true.  For though the People are apt to attach themselves more to the House of Commons, than to any other Member of the Constitution, that House being chosen by them as their Representatives, and as the public Guardians of their Liberty; yet are there Instances where the House, even when in Opposition to the Crown, has not been follow'd by the People; as we may particularly observe in the _Tory_ House of Commons in the Reign of King _William_.  Were the Members  of the House obliged to receive Instructions from their Constituents, like the _Dutch_ Deputies, this would entirely alter the Case; and, if such immense Power and Riches, as those of the whole Commons of _Britain_, were brought into the Scale, 'tis not easy to conceive, that the Crown could either influence that Multitude of People, or withstand that Over-ballance of Property.  'Tis true, the Crown has great Influence over the collective Body of _Britain_ in the Elections of Members; but were this Influence, which at present is only exerted once in seven Years, to be employ'd in bringing over the People to every Vote, it would soon be wasted; and no Skill, Popularity or Revenue, could support it.  I must, therefore, be of Opinion, that an Alteration, in this Particular, would introduce a total Alteration in our Government, and would soon reduce it to a pure Republic; and, perhaps, to a Republic of no inconvenient Form.  For though the People collected in a Body, like the _Roman_ Tribes, be quite unfit for Government, yet when dispersed in small Bodies, they are more susceptible both of Reason and Order; the Force of popular Currents and Tides is, in some Measure, broke; and the  public Interest may be pursued with Method and Constancy.  But 'tis needless to reason any farther concerning a Form of Government, which is never likely to have place in _Britain_, and which seems not to be the Aim of any Party amongst us.  Let us cherish and improve our ancient Government as much as possible, without encouraging a Passion for such dangerous Novelties.

I SHALL conclude this Subject with observing, that the present political Controversy, with regard to _Instructions_, is a very frivolous one, and can never be brought to any Decision, as it is managed by both Parties.  The Country-Party do not pretend, that a Member is absolutely bound to follow Instructions, as an Ambassador or General is confined by his Orders, and that his Vote is not to be received in the House, but so far as it is conformable to them.  The Court-Party, again, do not pretend, that the Sentiments of the People ought to have no Weight with every Member; much less that he ought to despise the Sentiments of those whom he represents, and with whom he is more particularly connected.  And if their Sentiments be

of Weight, why ought they not to express these Sentiments?  The Question, then, is only concerning the Degrees of Weight which ought to be plac'd on Instructions.  But such is the Nature of Language, that 'tis impossible for it to express distinctly these different Degrees; and if Men will carry on a Controversy on this Head, it may well happen, that they may differ in their Language, and yet agree in their Sentiments; and differ in their Sentiments, and yet agree in their Language.  Besides, how is it possible to fix these Degrees, considering the Variety of Affairs that come before the House, and the Variety of Places which Members represent?  Ought the Instructions of _Totness_ to have the same Weight as those of _London_?  Or Instructions, with regard to the _Convention_, which respected foreign Politics, to have the same Weight as those with regard to the _Excise_, which respected only our domestic Affairs?

ESSAY VIII.

_Of the_ INDEPENDENCY _of_

PARLIAMENT.

I HAVE frequently observ'd, in comparing the Conduct of the _Court_ and _Country_ Parties, that the former are commonly less assuming and dogmatical in Conversation, more apt to make Concessions; and tho' not, perhaps, more susceptible of Conviction, yet more able to bear Contradiction than the latter; who are apt to fly out upon any Opposition, and to regard one as a mercenary designing Fellow, if he argues with any Coolness and Impartiality, or makes any Concessions to their Adversaries.  This is a Fact, which, I believe, every one may have observ'd, who has been much in Companies where political Questions have been discuss'd; tho, were one to ask the Reason of this Difference, every Party wou'd be apt to assign a different Reason.  Gentlemen in the _Opposition_ will ascribe it to the very Nature of their Party, which, being founded on public Spirit, and a Zeal for the Constitution, cannot easily endure such Doctrines, as are of pernicious Consequence to Liberty.  The Courtiers, on the other Hand, will be apt to put us in Mind of the Clown mention'd by Lord _Shaftsbury_.  "A Clown, says that <1> excellent Author, once took a Fancy to hear the _Latin_ Disputes of Doctors at an University.  He was ask'd what Pleasure he could take in viewing such Combatants, when he cou'd never know so much, as which of the Parties had the better.  _For that Matter_, reply'd the Clown, _I a'n't such a Fool neither, but I can see who's the first that puts to'other into a Passion_.  Nature herself dictated this Lesson to the Clown, that he who had the better of the Argument wou'd be easy and well-humour'd:  But he who was unable to support his Cause by Reason, wou'd naturally lose his Temper, and grow violent." TO which of these Reasons shall we adhere?  To neither of them, in my Opinion; unless we have a-mind to inlist ourselves, and become Zealots in either Party.  I believe I can assign the Reason of this different Conduct of the two Parties, without offending either.  The Country-Party are plainly most popular at present, and, perhaps, have been so in most Administrations:  So that, being accustom'd to prevail in Company, they cannot endure to hear their Opinions controverted, but are as confident on the publick Favour, as if they were supported in all their Sentiments by the most infallible Demonstration.  The Courtiers, on the other Hand, are commonly so run down by your popular Talkers, that if you speak to them with any Moderation, or make them the smallest Concessions, they think themselves extremely oblig'd to you, and are apt to return the Favour by a like Moderation and Facility on their Part.  To be furious and passionate, they know, wou'd only gain them the Character of _shameless Mercenaries_; not that of _zealous Patriots_, which is the Character that such a warm Behaviour is apt to acquire to the other Party. IN all Controversies, we find, without regarding the Truth or Falshood on either Side, that those who defend the establish'd and popular Opinions, are always the most dogmatical and imperious in their Stile:  While their Adversaries affect a most extraordinary Gentleness and Moderation, in order to soften, as much as possible, any Prejudices that may ly against them.  Consider the Behaviour of our _Free-thinkers_ of all Denominations, whether they be such as decry all Revelation, or only oppose the exorbitant Power of the Clergy; _Collins, Tindal, Foster, Hoadley_.  Compare their Moderation, and Good-manners, with the furious Zeal and Scurrility of their Adversaries, and you will be convinc'd of the Truth of my Observation.  A like Difference may be observ'd in the Conduct of those _French_ Writers, who maintain'd the Controversy, with regard to ancient and modern Learning.  _Boileau, Monsieur & Madame Dacier, l'Abbe de Bos_, who defended the Party of the Ancients, mixt their Reasonings with Satyre and Invective:  While _Fontenelle, la Motte, Charpentier_, and even _Perrault_ never transgress'd the Bounds of Moderation and Good-breeding; tho' provok'd by the most severe Railleries of their Adversaries.

I MUST, however, observe, that this Remark, with regard to the seeming Moderation of the _Court_ Party, is intirely confin'd to Conversation, and to Gentlemen who have been engag'd by Interest or Inclination in that Party.  For as to the Court-Writers, being commonly hir'd Scriblers, they are altogether as scurrilous as the Mercenaries of the other Party, nor has the _Gazeteer_ any Advantage, in this Respect, above _Common Sense_.  A Man of Education will, in any Party, discover himself to be such, by his Good-breeding and Decency; as a Scoundrel will always betray the opposite Qualities.  _The false Accusers accused_, &c. is very scurrillous; tho' that Side of the Question, being least popular, shou'd be defended with most Moderation.  When L--d _B----e_, L---d _M----t_, Mr. _L----n_ take the Pen in Hand, tho' they write with Warmth, they presume not upon their Popularity so far, as to transgress the Bounds of Decency.

I AM led into this Train of Reflection, by considering some Papers wrote upon that grand Topic of _Court-Influence, and Parliamentary Dependence_, where, in my humble Opinion, the Country-Party show too rigid an Inflexibility, and too great a Jealousy of making Concessions to their Adversaries.  Their Reasonings lose their Force, by being carry'd too far; and the Popularity of their Opinions has seduc'd them to neglect, in some Measure, their Justness and Solidity.  The following Reasoning will, I hope, serve to justify me in this Opinion.

POLITICAL Writers have establish'd it as a Maxim, That in contriving any System of Government, and fixing the several Checks and Controuls of the Constitution, every Man ought to be suppos'd a _Knave_, and to have no other End, in all his Actions, but private Interest.  By this Interest we must govern him, and, by Means of it, make him co-operate to publick Good, notwithstanding his insatiable Avarice and Ambition.  Without this, say they, we shall in vain boast of the Advantages of any Constitution, and shall find, in the End, that we have no Security for our Liberties or Possessions, except the Good-will of our Rulers; that is, we shall have no Security at all.

'TIS therefore a just _political_ Maxim, _That every Man must be supposed a Knave_:  Tho', at the same Time, I must own it appears somewhat strange, that a Maxim should be true in _Politics_, which is false in _Fact_.  But to satisfy us on this Head, we may consider, that Men are generally more honest in their private than in their public Character, and will go greater Lengths to serve a Party, than where their own private Interest is alone concerned.  Honour is a great Check upon Mankind:  But where a considerable Body of Men act together, this Check is, in a great Measure, removed; since a Man is sure to be approved of by his own Party, for what promotes the common Interest, and soon learns to despise the Clamours of his Adversaries.  To which we may add, that every Court or Senate is determined by the Majority; so that, if Self-Interest influences only the Majority, (as it will always do in the present depraved State of Mankind) the whole Senate follows the Allurements of this separate Interest, and acts as if it contained not one Member, who had any Regard to public Interest and Liberty.

WHEN, therefore, there offers to my Censure, and Examination, any Plan of Government, real or imaginary, where the Power is distributed among several Courts, and several Orders of Men, I always consider the private Interest of each Court, and each Order; and, if I find, that, by the artful Division of the Power, the private Interest must necessarily, in its Operation, concur with the publick, I pronounce that Government to be wise and happy.  If, on the contrary, the private Interest of each Order be not check'd, and be not directed to publick Interest, I shall look for nothing but Faction, Disorder, and Tyranny from such a Government.  In this Opinion I am justified by Experience, as well as by the Authority of all Philosophers and Politicians, both ancient and modern.

HOW much, therefore, would it have surprised such a Genius, as _Cicero_, or _Tacitus_, to have been told, That, in a future Age, there should arise a very regular System of _mixt_ Government, where the Power was so distributed, that one Rank, whenever it pleased, might swallow up all the rest, and engross the whole Power of the Constitution.  Such a Government, they would have been apt to say, will not be a mixt Government.  For so great is the natural Ambition of Men, that they are never satisfied with Power; and if one Order of Men, by pursuing its own Interest, can usurp upon every other Order, it will certainly do so, and render itself, as far as possible, absolute and uncontroulable.

BUT, in this Opinion, Experience shows they would have been mistaken.  For this is actually the Case with the _British_ Constitution.  The Share of Power allotted by our Constitution to the House of Commons is so great, that it absolutely commands all the other Parts of our Government.  The King's legislative Power is plainly no proper Check to it.  For tho' the King has a Negative in the passing of all Laws; yet this, in Fact, is esteemed of so little Moment, that whatever passes the two Houses, is always sure to be pass'd into a Law, and the Royal Assent is little better than a mere Form.  The principal Weight of the Crown lies in the executive Power.  But besides that the executive Power, in every Government, is altogether subordinate to the legislative; besides this, I say, the Exercise of this Power requires an immense Expence, and the Commons have assumed to themselves the sole Power of disposing of publick Money.  How easy, therefore, would it be for that House to wrest from the Crown all these Powers, one after another, by making every Grant of Money conditional, and choosing their Time so well, that their Refusal of Subsidies should only distress the Government, without giving foreign Powers any Advantage over us?  Did the House of Commons depend in the same Manner on the King, and had none of the Members any Property but from his Gift, would not he command all their Resolutions, and be from that Moment absolute?  As to the House of Lords, they are a very powerful Support to the Crown as long as they are, in their Turn, supported by it; but both Experience and Reason show us, that they have no Force nor Authority sufficient to maintain themselves alone, without any such Support. How, therefore, shall we solve this Paradox?  And by what Means is this Member of our Constitution confin'd within its proper Limits; since, from our very Constitution, it must necessarily have as much Power as it demands, and can only be confin'd by itself?  How is this consistent with our constant Experience of human Nature?  I answer, That the Interest of the Body is here restrain'd by the Interest of the Individuals, and that the House of Commons stretches not its Power, because such an Usurpation would be contrary to the Interest of the Majority of its Members.  The Crown has so many Offices at its Disposal, that when assisted by the honest and disinterested Part of the House, it will always command the Resolutions of the whole; so far, at least, as to preserve the ancient Constitution from  Danger.  We may, therefore, give to this Influence what Name we please; we may call it by the invidious Appellations of _Corruption_ and _Dependence_; but some Degree and some Kind of it are inseparable from the very Nature of the Constitution, and necessary to the Preservation of our mix'd Government. INSTEAD then of asserting <2> absolutely, that the Dependence of Parliament, in every Degree, is an Infringement of _British_ Liberty, the Country-Party would have done better to have made some Concessions to their Adversaries, and have only examined what was the proper Degree of this Dependence, beyond which it became dangerous to Liberty.  But such a Moderation is not to be expected of Party-men of any Kind.  After a Concession of this Nature, all Declamation must be abandoned; and a serious calm Enquiry into the proper Degrees of Court-Influence, and Parliamentary Dependence would have been expected by the Readers.  And tho' the Advantage, in such a Controversy, might possibly remain to the _Country-Party_; yet the Victory would not have been so compleat as they wish for, nor would a true Patriot have given an entire Loose to his Zeal, for fear of running Matters into a contrary Extreme, by diminishing too <3> far the Influence of the Crown.  'Twas, therefore, thought best to deny, that this Extreme could ever be dangerous to the Constitution, or that the Crown could ever have too little Influence over Members of Parliament.

ALL Questions concerning the proper Medium betwixt any two Extremes are very difficult to be decided; both because it is difficult to find _Words_ proper to fix this Medium, and because the Good and Ill, in such Cases, run so gradually into each other, as even to render our _Sentiments_ doubtful and uncertain.  But there is a peculiar Difficulty in the present Case, which would embarrass the most knowing and most impartial Examiner.  The Power of the Crown is always lodged in a single Person, either King or Minister; and as this Person may have either a greater or less Degree of Ambition, Capacity, Courage, Popularity or Fortune, the Power, which is too great in one Hand, may become too little in another. In pure Republics, where the Power is distributed among several Assemblies or Senates, the Checks and Controuls are more regular in their Operation; because the Members of such numerous Assemblies may be presumed to be always nearly equal in Capacity and Virtue; and 'tis only their Number, Riches, or Authority, that enter into Consideration.  But a limited Monarchy admits not of any such Stability; nor is it possible to assign to the Crown such a determinate Degree of Power, as will, in every Hand, form a proper Counter-ballance to the other Parts of the Constitution.  This is an unavoidable Disadvantage, among the many Advantages attending that Species of Government.

ESSAY IX.

_Whether the_ BRITISH GOVERNMENT _inclines more to_

ABSOLUTE MONARCHY, _or to a_ REPUBLIC.

IT affords a violent Prejudice against almost every Art and Science, that no prudent Man, however sure of his Principles, dare prophesy concerning any Event, or foretell the remote Consequences of Things.  No Physician will venture to pronounce concerning the Condition of his Patient a Fortnight or Month after:  And still less dare a Politician foretell the Situation of public Affairs a few Years hence.  _Harrington_ thought himself so sure of his general Principle, _That the Ballance of Power depends on that of Property_, that he ventured to pronounce it impossible ever to re-establish Monarchy in _England_:



94

But his Book was scarce published when the King was restored; and we see that Monarchy has ever since subsisted upon the same Footing as before.  Notwithstanding of this unlucky Example, I will venture to examine a very important Question, _viz. Whether the_ British _Government inclines more to Absolute Monarchy, or to a Republic; and in which of these two Species of Government it will most probably terminate_?  As there seems not to be any great Danger of a sudden Revolution either Way, I shall at least escape the Shame attending my Temerity, if I should be found to have been mistaken.

THOSE who assert, That the Ballance of our Government inclines towards Absolute Monarchy may support their Opinion by the following Reasons.  That Property has a great Influence on Power cannot possibly be denied; but yet the general Maxim, _That the Ballance of the one depends upon the Ballance of the other_, must be received with several Limitations.  'Tis evident, that much less Property in a single Hand will be able to counter-ballance a greater Property in several Hands; not only because it is difficult to make many



95

Persons combine in the same Views and Measures; but also because Property, when united, causes much greater Dependence, than the same Property, when dispersed.  An hundred Persons, of 1000 a Year, apiece, can consume all their Income, and no Body shall ever be the better for them, except their Servants and Tradesmen, who justly regard their Profits as the Product of their own Labour.  But a Man possest of 100,000 a Year, if he has either any Generosity, or any Cunning, may create a great Dependence by Obligations, and still a greater by Expectations.  Hence we find, that in all free Governments any Subject exorbitantly rich has always created Jealousy, even tho' his Riches bore no manner of Proportion to the Riches of the State.  _Crassus_'s Fortune, if I remember well, amounted only to <1> Three Thousand Talents a Year; and yet we find, that though his Genius was nothing extraordinary, he was able, by Means of his Riches alone, to counter-ballance, during his Life-time, the Power of _Caesar_, who afterwards became Master of the World.  The Wealth of



96

the _Medicis_ made them Masters of _Florence_; tho', 'tis probable, it was very inconsiderable, compared to the united Property of that opulent Republic.

THESE Considerations are apt to make one entertain a very magnificent Idea of the _British_ Spirit and Love of Liberty; since we cou'd maintain our free Government, during so many Centuries, against our Sovereigns, who, besides the Power and Dignity and Majesty of the Crown, have always been possest of much more Property, than any Subject has ever enjoy'd in any Common-wealth.  But it may be said, that this Spirit, however great, will never be able to support itself against that immense Property, which is now lodg'd in the King, and which is still increasing.  Upon a moderate Computation, there are near three Millions at the Disposal of the Crown.  The Civil List amounts to near a Million; the Collection of all Taxes to another Million; and the Employments in the Army and Navy, along with Ecclesiastical Preferments, to above a third Million:  A monstruous Sum, and what may fairly be computed to be more than a thirtieth Part of the whole Income and Labour



97

of the Kingdom.  When we add to this immense Property, the increasing Luxury of the Nation, our Proneness to Corruption, along with the great Power and Prerogatives of the Crown, and the Command of such numerous military Forces, there is no one but must despair, without extraordinary Efforts, of being able to support our free Government much longer under all these Disadvantages.

ON the other Hand, those who maintain, that the Byass of the _British_ Government leans towards a Republick, may support their Opinion by very specious Arguments.  It may be said, that though this immense Property in the Crown, be join'd to the Dignity of first Magistrate, and to many other legal Powers and Prerogatives, which should naturally give it a greater Influence; yet it really becomes less dangerous to Liberty upon that very Account.  Were _Britain_ a Republick, and were any private Man possess'd of a Revenue, a third, or even a tenth Part as large as that of the Crown, he would very justly excite Jealousy; because he would infallibly have great Authority in the Government:  And such an irregular Authority, not avowed by the Laws,



98

is always more dangerous than a much greater Authority, which is derived from them.  A <2> Man possess'd of usurp'd Authority, can set no Bounds to his Pretensions:  His Partizans have Liberty to hope for every Thing in his Favours:  His Enemies provoke his Ambition, along with his Fears, by the Violence of their Opposition:  And the Government being thrown into a Ferment, every corrupted Humour in the State naturally gathers to him.  On the contrary, a legal Authority, though very great, has always some Bounds, which terminate both the Hopes and Pretensions of the Persons possess'd of it:  The Laws must have provided a Remedy against its Excesses:  Such an eminent Magistrate has much to fear, and little to hope from his Usurpations:  And as his legal Authority is quietly submitted to, he has little Temptation and little Opportunity of extending it farther.  Besides, it happens, with regard to ambitious Aims and Projects, what may be observed with regard to Sects of Philosophy and Religion.  A new Sect excites such a Ferment,



99

and is both opposed and defended with such Vehemence, that it spreads always faster, and multiplies its Partizans with greater Rapidity, than any old established Opinion, recommended by the Sanction of the Laws and of Antiquity.  Such is the Nature of Novelty, that where any thing pleases, it becomes doubly agreeable, if new; but, if it displeases, it is doubly displeasing, upon that very Account.  And, in most Cases, the Violence of Enemies is favourable to ambitious Projects, as well as the Zeal of Partizans.

IT may farther be said, That tho' Men be very much govern'd by Interest; yet even Interest itself, and all human Affairs are merely govern'd by _Opinion_.  Now, there has been a very sudden and a very sensible Change in the Opinions of Men within these last Fifty Years, by the Progress of Learning and of Liberty.  Most People, in this Island, have divested themselves of all superstitious Reverence to Names and Authority:  The Clergy have entirely lost their Credit:  Their Pretensions and Doctrines have been ridicul'd; and even Religion can scarce support itself in the World.  The mere  Name of _King_ commands little Respect; and to talk of a King as GOD's Vicegerent upon Earth, or to give him any of those magnificent Titles, which formerly dazl'd Mankind, wou'd but excite Laughter in every one.  Tho' the Crown, by Means of its large Revenue, may maintain its Authority in Times of Tranquility, upon private Interest and Influence; yet, as the least Shock or Convulsion must break all these Interests to Pieces, the kingly Power, being no longer supported by the settled Principles and Opinions of Men, will immediately dissolve.  Had Men been in the same Disposition at the _Revolution_, as they are at present, Monarchy wou'd have run a great Risque of being entirely lost in this Island.

DURST I venture to deliver my own Sentiments amidst these opposite Arguments, I wou'd assert, that unless there happen some extraordinary Convulsion, the Power of the Crown, by Means of its large Revenue, is rather upon the Increase; tho', at the same Time, I own, that its Progress seems to me very slow, and almost insensible.  The Tide has run long, and with some Rapidity, to the



101

Side of popular Government, and is just beginning to turn towards Monarchy.

'TIS well known, that every Government must come to a Period, and that Death is unavoidable to the political as well as to the animal Body.  But, as one Kind of Death may be preferable to another, it may be enquir'd, Whether it be more desirable for the _British_ Constitution to terminate in a popular Government, or in absolute Monarchy?  Here I wou'd declare frankly, that tho' Liberty be infinitely preferable to Slavery, in almost every Case; yet I wou'd much rather wish to see an absolute Monarch than a Republick in this Island.  For, let us consider, what Kind of Republick we have Reason to expect.  The Question is not concerning any fine imaginary Republick, which a Man may form a Plan of in his Closet.  There is no Doubt, but a popular Government may be imagin'd more perfect than absolute Monarchy, or even than our present Constitution.  But what Reason have we to expect that any such Government will ever be established in _Britain_, upon the Dissolution of our Monarchy?  If any single Person acquire Power enough to take our Constitution to Pieces,



102

and put it up a-new, he is really an absolute Monarch; and we have had already an Instance of this Kind, sufficient to convince us, that such a Person will never resign his Power, or establish any free Government.  Matters, therefore, must be trusted to their natural Progress and Operation; and the House of Commons, according to its present Constitution, must be the only Legislature in such a popular Government.  The Inconveniences, attending such a Situation of Affairs, present themselves by Thousands.  If the House of Commons, in such a Case, ever dissolves itself, which is not to be expected, we may look for a Civil War every Election.  If it continues itself, we shall suffer all the Tyranny of a Faction, sub-divided into new Factions:  And as such a violent Government cannot long subsist, we shall, at last, after infinite Convulsions and Civil Wars, find Repose in absolute Monarchy, which it wou'd have been happier for us to have establish'd peaceably from the Beginning.  Absolute Monarchy, therefore, is the easiest Death, the true _Euthanasia_ of the _British_ Constitution.



103

THUS, if we have Reason to be more jealous of Monarchy, because the Danger is more imminent from that Quarter; we have also Reason to be more jealous of popular Government, because that Danger is more terrible.  This may teach us a Lesson of Moderation in all our political Controversies.

ESSAY X.

_Of_ PARTIES _in general_.

OF all Men, that distinguish themselves by memorable Atchievements, the first Place of Honour, in my Opinion, is due to LEGISLATORS, and Founders of States, who transmit a System of Laws and Institutions to secure the Peace, Happiness and Liberty of future Generations.  The Influence of useful Inventions in the Arts and Sciences may, perhaps, extend farther than those of wise Laws, whose Effects are limited both in Time and Place; but the Benefit arising from the former is not so sensible as that which proceeds from the latter.  Speculative Sciences, do, indeed, improve the Mind; but this Advantage reaches only to a few Persons, who have Leisure to apply themselves to them.  And as to practical Arts, which increase the  Commodities and Enjoyments of Life, 'tis well known, that Mens Happiness consists not so much in an Abundance of these, as in the Peace and Security with which they possess them; and those Blessings can only be derived from good Government.  Not to mention, that general Virtue and good Morals in a State, which are so requisite to Happiness, can never arise from the most refined Precepts of Philosophy, or even the severest Injunctions of Religion; but must proceed entirely from the virtuous Education of the Youth, the Effect of wise Laws and Institutions.  I must, therefore, be of a different Opinion from my Lord BACON in this Particular, and must regard Antiquity as somewhat unjust in its Distribution of Honour, when it made Gods of all the Inventors of useful Arts, such as _Ceres_, _Bacchus_, _Aesculapius_; and dignified Legislators, such as _Romulus_ and _Theseus_, only with the Appellation of Demi-Gods and Heroes.

AS much as Legislators and Founders of States ought to be honoured and respected among Men, as much ought the Founders of Sects and Factions to be detested and hated;  because the Influence of Factions is directly contrary to that of Laws.  Factions subvert Government, render Laws impotent, and beget the fiercest Animosities among Men of the same Nation, who ought to give mutual Assistance and Protection to each other.  And what shou'd render the Founders of Factions more odious is, the Difficulty of extirpating Factions, when once they have taken Rise in any State.  They naturally propagate themselves for many Centuries, and seldom end but by the total Dissolution of that Government in which they are planted.  They are, besides, Seeds, which grow most plentifully in the richest Soils; and though despotic Governments be not entirely free from them, it must be confess'd, that they rise more easily, and propagate themselves faster in free Governments, where they always infect the Legislature itself, which alone cou'd be able, by the steady Application of Rewards and Punishments, to eradicate them.

FACTIONS or Parties may be divided into PERSONAL and REAL; that is, into Factions founded on personal Friendship or Animosity among those who compose the Factions,  and into those founded on some real Difference of Sentiment or Interest.  The Reason of this Distinction is obvious; though I must acknowledge, that Parties are seldom found pure and unmixt, either of the one Kind or the other.  'Tis not often seen, that a Government divides into Factions, where there is no Difference in the Views of these Factions, either real or apparent, trivial or material:  And in those Factions, which are founded on the most real and most material Difference, there is always observed to be a great deal of personal Animosity or Affection.  But notwithstanding of this Mixture, a Party may be denominated either personal or real, according to that Principle which is predominant, and is found to have the greatest Influence.

PERSONAL Factions arise most easily in small Republics.  Every domestic Quarrel becomes an Affair of State.  Love, Vanity, Emulation, any Passion begets public Division, as well as Ambition and Resentment.  The _Neri_ and _Bianchi_ of _Florence_, the _Fregosi_ and _Adorni_ of _Genoa_, the _Colonnesi_ and _Orsini_ of modern _Rome_, were Parties of this Kind. MEN have such a Propensity to divide into personal Factions, that the smallest Appearance of real Difference will beget them.  What can be imagined more trivial than the Difference betwixt one Colour of Livery and another in Horse-Races?  And yet this Difference begot two most inveterate Factions in the _Greek_ Empire, the _Prasini_ and _Veneti_, who never suspended their Animosities, 'till they ruined that unhappy Government.

WE find in the _Roman_ History a very remarkable Faction betwixt two Tribes, the _Pollia_ and _Papiria_, which continu'd for the Space of near three hundred Years, and discover'd itself in their Suffrages at every Election of Magistrates <1>.  This Faction was the more  remarkable, that it could continue for so long a Tract of Time; even tho' it did not spread itself, nor draw any of the other Tribes into a Share of the Quarrel.  If Mankind had not a strong Propensity to such Divisions, the Indifference of the rest of the Community must have suppress'd this foolish Animosity, which had not any Aliment of new Benefits and Injuries, of Sympathy and Antipathy, which never fail to take Place, when the whole State is rent into two equal Factions.

NOTHING is more usual than to see Parties, which have begun upon a real Difference, continue even after that Difference is lost.  When Men are once inlisted on different Sides, they contract an Affection to the Persons with whom they are united, and an Animosity against their Antagonists:  And these Passions they often transmit to their Posterity.  The real Difference betwixt _Guelf_ and _Ghibbelline_ was long lost in _Italy_, before these Factions were extinguished.  The _Guelfs_ adher'd  to the Pope, the _Ghibbellines_ to the Emperor; and yet the Family of _Sforsa_, who were in Alliance with the Emperor, though they were _Guelfs_, being expelled _Milan_ by the King <2> of _France_, assisted by _Jacomo Trivulzio_ and the _Ghibbellines_, the Pope concurred with them, and they form'd Leagues with the Pope against the Emperor.

THE Civil Wars, which arose some few Years ago in _Morocco_, betwixt the _Blacks_ and _Whites_, merely on account of their Complexion, are founded on a very pleasant Difference.  We laugh at them; but I believe, were Things rightly examin'd, we afford much more Occasion of Ridicule to the _Moors_.  For pray, what are all the Wars of Religion, which have prevail'd in this polite and knowing Part of the World?  They are, in my Opinion, more absurd than the _Moorish_ Civil Wars.  The Difference of Complexion is a sensible and a real Difference:  But the Difference about an Article of Faith, which is utterly absurd and unintelligible, is not a real Difference of Sentiments, but only a Difference of a few Phrases and Expressions,  which one Party accepts of, without understanding them; and the other refuses, in the same Manner.  Besides, I do not find, that the _Whites_ in _Morocco_ ever impos'd on the _Blacks_ any Necessity of altering their Complexion, or threaten'd them with Inquisitions and penal Laws in case of Obstinacy:  Nor have the _Blacks_ been more unreasonable in this Particular.  But is a Man's Opinion, where he is able to form a real Opinion, more at his Disposal than his Complexion?  And can one be induc'd by Force or Fear to do more than paint and Disguise in the one Case as well as in the other?

_REAL_ Factions may be divided into Factions from _Interest_, from _Principle_, and from _Affection_.  Of all Factions, those from Interest are the most reasonable, and the most excusable.  Where two Orders of Men, such as the Nobles and People, have a distinct Authority in a Government, which is not very accurately ballanc'd and modell'd, they naturally follow a distinct Interest; nor can we reasonably expect a different Conduct from that Degree of Selfishness, which is implanted in human Nature.  It requires very great Skill  in a Legislator to prevent such Factions; and many Philosophers are of Opinion, that this Secret, like the _Grand Elixir_, or _Perpetual Motion_, may amuse Men in Theory, but can never possibly be reduc'd to Practice.  In despotick Governments, indeed, Factions often do not appear; but they are never the less real; or rather, they are more real and more pernicious, upon that very Account.  The distinct Orders of Men, Nobles and People, Soldiers and Merchants, have all a distinct Interest; but the more Powerful oppresses the Weaker with Impunity, and without Resistance; which begets a seeming Tranquillity in such Governments.

THERE has been an Attempt to divide the _landed_ and _trading_ Interest in _England_; but without Success.  The Interest of these two Bodies is not really distinct, and never will be so, till our publick Debts increase to such a Degree, as to become altogether oppressive and intolerable.

PARTIES from _Principles_, especially abstract speculative Principles, are known only to modern Times, and are, perhaps, the most  extraordinary and unaccountable _Phaenomena_, that have ever yet appear'd in human Affairs.  Where different Principles beget a Contrariety of Conduct, as all different political Principles do, the Matter may be more easily explain'd.  A Man, who esteems the true Right of Government to ly in one Man, or one Family, cannot easily agree with his Fellow-Citizen, who thinks, that another Man or Family is possest of this Right.  Each naturally wishes that Right may take Place, according to his own Notions of it.  But where the Difference of Principles begets no Contrariety of Action, but each may follow his own Way, without interfering with his Neighbour, as happens in all religious Controversies; what Madness, what Fury can beget such unhappy and such fatal Divisions?

TWO Men, travelling on the High-way, of whom one goes East, the other West, can easily pass each other, if the Way be broad enough:  But two Men, reasoning upon opposite Principles of Religion, cannot so easily pass, without shocking; tho' one shou'd think, that the Way were also, in that Case, sufficiently broad, and that each might proceed,  without Interruption, in his own Way.  But such is the Nature of the human Mind, that it always takes hold of every Mind that approaches it; and as it is wonderfully strengthen'd and corroborated by an Unanimity of Sentiments, so it is shock'd and disturb'd by any Contrariety.  Hence the Eagerness, which most People discover in a Dispute; and hence their Impatience of Opposition, even in the most speculative and indifferent Opinions.

THIS Principle, however frivolous it may appear, seems to have been the Origin of all religious Wars and Divisions.  But, as this Principle is universal in human Nature, its Effects wou'd not have been confin'd to one Age, and to one Sect of Religion, did it not there concur with other more accidental Causes, which raise it to such a Height, as to cause the highest Misery and Devastation.  Most Religions of the ancient World arose in the unknown Ages of Government, when Men were as yet barbarous and uninstructed, and the Prince, as well as Peasant, was dispos'd to receive, with implicite Faith, every pious Tale or Fiction that was offer'd him.  The Magistrate embrac'd the Religion of the People, and  entering cordially into the Care of sacred Matters, naturally acquir'd an Authority in them, and united the Ecclesiastical with the Civil Power.  But the _Christian_ Religion arising, while Principles directly opposite to it were firmly establish'd in the polite Part of the World, who despis'd the Nation that first broach'd this Novelty; no Wonder, that Christianity, in such Circumstances, was but little countenanc'd by the Civil Magistrate, and that the Priesthood were allowed to engross all the Authority in the new Sect.  So bad a Use did they make of this Power, even in those early Times, that the Persecutions of Christianity may, perhaps, <3> _in Part_, be ascrib'd to  the Violence instill'd by them into their Followers.  And the same Principles of Priestly Government continuing, after Christianity became the establish'd Religion, they have engender'd a Spirit of Persecution, which has ever since been the Poison of human Society, and the Source of the most inveterate Factions in every Government.  Such Factions, therefore, on the Part of the poor People, may justly be esteem'd Factions of _Principle_; but, on the Part of the Priests, who are the prime Movers, they are really Factions of _Interest_.

THERE is another Cause (beside the Authority of the Priests, and the Separation of the Ecclesiastical and Civil Powers) that has contributed to render _Christendom_ the Scene of religious Wars and Divisions.  Religions, that arise in Ages totally ignorant and barbarous,  consist mostly of traditional Tales and Fictions, which may be very different in every Sect, without being contrary to each other; and even when they are contrary, every one adheres to the Tradition of his own Sect, without much Reasoning or Disputation.  But as Philosophy was widely spread over the World, at the Time that Christianity arose, the Teachers of the new Sect were oblig'd to form a System of speculative Opinions; to divide, with some Accuracy, their Articles of Faith; and to explain, comment, confute, and confirm with all the Subtility of Argument and Science.  From hence naturally arose Keenness in Dispute, when Christianity came to be split into new Divisions and Heresies:  And this Keenness assisted the Priests in their pernicious Policy, of begetting a mutual Hatred and Antipathy among their deluded Followers.  Sects of Philosophy, in the ancient World, were more zealous than Parties of Religion; but, in modern Times, Parties of Religion are more furious and enrag'd than the most cruel Factions that ever arose from Interest and Ambition. I HAVE mention'd Parties from _Affection_ as a kind of _real_ Parties, beside those from _Interest_ and _Principle_.  By Parties from Affection, I understand those which are founded on the different Affections of Men towards particular Families and Persons, whom they desire to rule over them.  These Parties are often very violent; though, I must own, it is somewhat unaccountable, that Men shou'd attach themselves so strongly to Persons, whom they are no Way acquainted with, whom perhaps they never saw, and from whom they never received, nor can ever hope for any Favour.  Yet this we find often to be the Case, and even with Men, who, on other Occasions, discover no great Generosity of Spirit, nor are found to be easily transported by Friendship beyond their own Interest.  We are apt, I know not how, to think the Relation betwixt us and our Sovereign very close and intimate.  The Splendor of Majesty and Power bestows an Importance on the Fortunes even of a single Person.  And when a Man's Good-nature does not give him this imaginary Interest, his Ill-nature will do it, from Spite and Opposition to Persons whose Sentiments are different from his own.

NOTES

1.  As this Fact has not been much observed by Antiquaries or Politicians, I shall deliver it in the Words of the _Roman_ Historian.  _Populus_ Tusculanus _cum conjugibus ac liberis_ Romam _venit:  Ea multitudo, veste mutata, & specie reorum tribus circuit, genibus se omnium advolvens.  Plus itaque misericordia ad poenae veniam impetrandam, quam causa ad crimen purgandum valuit.  Tribus omnes, praeter_ Polliam, _antiquarunt legem_.  Polliae _sententia fuit, puberes verberatos necari, liberos conjugesque sub corona lege belli venire:  Memoriamque ejus irae_ Tusculanis _ in poenae tam atrocis auctores mansisse ad patris aetatem constat; nec quemquam fere ex_ Pollia _tribu candidatum_ Papiriam _ferre solitam_.

3.  I say, _in Part_; For 'tis a vulgar Error to imagine, that the Ancients were as great Friends to Toleration as the _English_ or _Dutch_ are at present.  The Laws against external Superstition were very ancient among the _Romans_; and the _Jews_ as well as _Christians_ were sometimes punish'd by them:  Tho', in general, these Laws were not rigorously executed.  Immediately after the Conquest of _Gaul_, they forbad all but the Natives to be initiated into the Religion of the _Druids_; and this was a Kind of Persecution.  In about a Century after their Conquest, they quite abolish'd that Superstition by penal Laws; which wou'd have been a very grievous Persecution, if the Imitation of the _Roman_ Manners had not, before-hand, wean'd the _Gauls_ from their ancient Prejudices.  _Suetonius in vita Claudii_.  This is an Instance of the usual Caution and Moderation of the _Romans_ in such Cases; and very different from their violent and sanguinary Method of treating the _Christians_.  Hence we may entertain a Suspicion, that those furious Persecutions of _Christianity_ were, in some Measure, owing to the imprudent Zeal and Bigotry of the first Propagators of that Sect; and Ecclesiastical History affords us many Reasons to confirm this Suspicion.

ESSAY XI.

_Of the_ PARTIES _of_ GREAT BRITAIN.

WERE the _British_ Government proposed as a Subject of Speculation to a studious Man, he wou'd immediately perceive in it a Source of Division and Party, which it wou'd be almost impossible for it, in any Administration, to avoid.  The just Ballance betwixt the Republican and Monarchical Part of our Constitution is really, in itself, so extreme delicate and uncertain, that when join'd to Mens Passions and Prejudices, 'tis impossible but different Opinions must arise concerning it, even among Persons of the best Understanding.  Those of mild Tempers, who love Peace and Order, and detest Sedition and Civil Wars, will always entertain more favourable Sentiments of Monarchy, than Men of bold and generous Spirits, who are passionate Lovers of Liberty, and think no Evil comparable to Subjection and Slavery.  And tho' all reasonable Men agree in general to preserve our mixt Government; yet when they come to Particulars, some will incline to trust larger Powers to the Crown, to bestow on it more Influence, and to guard against its Encroachments with less Caution, than others who are terrified at the most distant Approaches of Tyranny and despotick Power.  Thus there are Parties of PRINCIPLE involved in the very Nature of our Constitution, which may properly enough be denominated <1> COURT and COUNTRY Parties.  The  Strength and Violence of each of these Parties will much depend upon the particular Administration.  An Administration may be so bad, as to throw a great Majority into the Country Party; as a good Administration will reconcile to the Court many of the most passionate Lovers of Liberty.  But, however the Nation may fluctuate betwixt these two Parties, the Parties will always subsist, as long as we are govern'd by a limited Monarchy.

BUT, besides this Difference of _Principle_, those Parties are very much fomented by a Difference of INTEREST, without which they cou'd scarce ever be dangerous or violent.  The Crown will naturally bestow all its Trust and Power upon those, whose Principles, real or pretended, are most favourable to Monarchical Government; and this Temptation will naturally engage them to go greater Lengths than their Principles wou'd otherwise carry them.  Their Antagonists, who are disappointed in their ambitious Aims, throw themselves into the Party whose Principles incline them to be most jealous of Royal Power, and naturally carry those Principles to a greater Length than sound Politics will justify.  Thus, the  _Court_ and _Country_ Parties, which are the genuine Factions of the _British_ Government, are a Kind of mixt Parties, and are influenced, partly by Principle, partly by Interest.  The Heads of the Parties are commonly most governed by the latter Motive; the inferior Members of them by the former.  I must be understood to mean this of Persons who have any Motive for taking Party on any Side.  For, to tell the Truth, the greatest Part are commonly Men who associate themselves they know not why; from Example, from Passion, from Idleness.  But still it is requisite there be some Source of Division, either in Principle or Interest; otherwise such Persons wou'd not find Parties, to which they cou'd associate themselves.

AS to Ecclesiastical Parties; we may observe, that, in all Ages of the World, Priests have been Enemies to Liberty <2>, and 'tis  certain, that this steady Conduct of theirs must have been founded on fixt Reasons of Interest and Ambition.  Liberty of thinking, and of expressing our Thoughts, is always fatal to Priestly Power, and to those pious Frauds on which it is commonly founded; and, by an infallible Connexion, which is found among every Species of Liberty, this Privilege can never be enjoy'd, at least, has never yet been enjoy'd, but in a free Government.  Hence it must happen, in such a Government as that of _Britain_, that the establish'd Clergy will always be of the _Court_-Party; as, on the contrary, Dissenters of all Kinds will be of the _Country_-Party; since they can never hope for that Toleration they stand in need of, but by Means of our free Government.  All Princes, that have aimed at despotic Power, have known this important Interest of gaining the establish'd Clergy:  As the Clergy, on their Side, have shewn a great Facility of entring into the Views of such Princes.  _Gustavus Vaza_ was, perhaps, the only ambitious Monarch, that ever depress'd the Church, at the same Time, that he discouraged Liberty.  But the exorbitant Power of the Bishops in _Sweden_, who, at that Time, overtop'd the Crown, along with  their Attachment to a foreign Family, was the Reason of his embracing such an unusual System of Politics.

THIS Observation concerning the Propensity of Priests to despotick Power, and to the Government of a single Person, is not true with regard to one Sect only.  The _Presbyterian_ and _Calvinistick_ Clergy in _Holland_ were always profess'd Friends to the Power of the Family of _Orange_; as the _Arminians_, who were esteem'd Heretics, were always of the _Louvestein_ Faction, and zealous for Liberty.  But if a Prince has the Choice of both, 'tis easy to see, that he will prefer the Episcopal to the Presbyterian Form of Government; both because of the greater Affinity betwixt Monarchy and Episcopacy, and because of the Facility which a Prince finds in such a Government, of ruling the Clergy, by Means of their Ecclesiastical Superiors.

IF we consider the first Rise of Parties in _England_, during the Civil Wars, we shall find, that it was exactly conformable to this general Theory, and that the Species of the Government gave Birth to these Parties, by a regular  and infallible Operation.  The _English_ Constitution, before that Time, had lain in a Kind of Confusion; yet so, as that the Subjects possess'd many noble Privileges, which, though not, perhaps, exactly bounded and secur'd by Law, were universally deem'd, from long Possession, to belong to them as their Birth-Right.  An ambitious, or rather an ignorant, Prince arose, who esteem'd all these Privileges to be Concessions of his Predecessors, revocable at Pleasure; and, in Prosecution of this Principle, he openly acted in Violation of Liberty, during the Course of several Years.  Necessity, at last, constrain'd him to call a Parliament:  The Spirit of Liberty arose:  The Prince, being without any Support, was obliged to grant every Thing required of him:  And his Enemies, jealous and implacable, set no Bounds to their Pretensions.  Here then begun those Contests, in which it was no Wonder, that Men of that Age were divided into different Parties; since, even at this Day, the Impartial are at a Loss to decide concerning the Justice of the Quarrel.  The Pretensions of the Parliament, if yielded to, broke the Ballance of our Constitution, by rendering the Government almost entirely Republican.  If  not yielded to, we were, perhaps, still in Danger of despotic Power, from the settled Principles and inveterate Habits of the King, which had plainly appear'd in every Concession that he had been constrain'd to make to his People.  In this Question, so delicate and uncertain, Men naturally fell to the Side which was most conformable to their usual Principles; and those, who were the most passionate Favourers of Monarchy declar'd for the King, as the zealous Friends of Liberty sided with the Parliament.  The Hopes of Success being nearly equal on both Sides, _Interest_ had little Influence in this Contest:  So that ROUND-HEAD and CAVALIER were merely Parties of Principle; neither of which disown'd either Monarchy or Liberty; but the former Party inclin'd most to the Republican Part of our Government, and the latter to the Monarchical.  In which respect they may be consider'd as Court and Country-Party enflam'd into a Civil War, by an unhappy Concurrence of Circumstances, and by the turbulent Spirit of the Age.  The Commonwealth's Men, and the Partizans of despotic Power, lay conceal'd in both Parties, and form'd but an inconsiderable Part of them. THE Clergy had concurr'd, in a shameless Manner, with the King's arbitrary Designs, according to their usual Maxims in such Cases:  And, in Return, were allow'd to persecute their Adversaries, whom they call'd Heretics and Schismatics.  The establish'd Clergy were Episcopal; the Non-conformists Presbyterian:  So that all Things concurr'd to throw the former, without Reserve, into the King's Party; and the latter into that of the Parliament.  The _Cavaliers_ being the Court-Party, and the _Round-heads_ the Country-Party, the Union was infallible betwixt the former and the establish'd Prelacy, and betwixt the latter and Presbyterian Non-conformists.  This Union is so natural, according to the general Principles of Politics, that it requires some very extraordinary Situation of Affairs to break it.

EVERY one knows the Event of this Quarrel; fatal to the King first, and to the Parliament afterwards.  After many Confusions and Revolutions, the Royal Family was at last restor'd, and the Government establish'd on the same Footing as before.  _Charles_ II. was not made wiser by the dreadful Example of his  Father; but prosecuted the same Measures, tho', at first, with more Secrecy and Caution.  New Parties arose, under the Appellations of WHIG and TORY, which have continued ever since to confound and distract our Government.  What the Nature is of these Parties, is, perhaps, one of the most difficult Questions that can be met with, and is a Proof, that History may contain Problems, as uncertain as any that are to be found in the most abstract Sciences.  We have seen the Conduct of these two Parties, during the Course of Seventy Years, in a vast Variety of Circumstances, possess'd of Power, and depriv'd of it, during Peace and during War:  We meet with Persons, who profess themselves of one Side or t'other, every Hour, in Company, in our Pleasures, in our serious Occupations:  We ourselves are constrain'd, in a Manner, to take Party; and living in a Country of the highest Liberty, every one may openly declare all his Sentiments and Opinions:  And yet we are at a Loss to tell the Nature, Pretensions, and Principles of the two Parties.   The Question is, perhaps, in itself, somewhat difficult; but has been render'd more so, by the Prejudices and Violence of Party. WHEN we compare the Parties of _Whig_ and _Tory_, to those of _Round-head_ and _Cavalier_, the most obvious Difference, that appears betwixt them, consists in the Doctrines of _passive Obedience_, and _indefeasible Right_, which were but little heard of among the _Cavaliers_, but became the universal Doctrine, and were the true Characteristic of a _Tory_.  Were these Principles push'd into their most obvious Consequences, they imply a formal Renunciation of all our Liberties, and an Avowal of absolute Monarchy; since nothing can be a greater Absurdity than a limited Power, which must not be resisted, even when it exceeds its Limitations.  But as the most rational Principles are often but a weak Counterpoise to Passion; 'tis no Wonder, that these absurd Principles, _sufficient_, according to a justly celebrated <3> Author, _to shock the common Sense of a_ HOTTENTOT _or_ SAMOIEDE, were found too weak for that Effect.  The _Tories_, as Men, were Enemies to Oppression; and also, as _Englishmen_, they were Enemies to despotic Power.  Their Zeal for Liberty, was, perhaps, less fervent than that  of their Antagonists; but was sufficient to make them forget all their general Principles, when they saw themselves openly threatned with a Subversion of the ancient Government.  From these Sentiments arose the _Revolution_; an Event of mighty Consequence, and the firmest Foundation of _British_ Liberty.  The Conduct of the _Tories_, during that Event, and after it, will afford us a true Insight into the Nature of that Party.

IN the _first_ Place, They appear to have had the Sentiments of true _Britons_ in their Affection to Liberty, and in their determin'd Resolution not to sacrifice it to any abstract Principles whatsoever, or to any imaginary Rights of Princes.  This Part of their Character might justly have been doubted of before the _Revolution_, from the obvious Tendency of their avow'd Principles, and from their almost unbounded Compliances with a Court, that made little Secret of its arbitrary Designs.  The _Revolution_ show'd them to have been, in this Respect, nothing but a genuine _Court-Party_, such as might be expected in a _British_ Government:  That is, _Lovers of Liberty, but greater Lovers of Monarchy_.  It must, however,  be confest, that they carry'd their monarchical Principles further, even in Practice, but more so in Theory, than was, in any Degree, consistent with a limited Government.

_Secondly_, NEITHER their Principles nor Affections concurr'd with the Settlement made at the _Revolution_, or with that which has since taken Place.  This Part of their Character may seem contradictory to the former; since any other Settlement, in those Circumstances of the Nation, must have been dangerous, if not fatal to Liberty.  But the Heart of Man is made to reconcile the most glaring Contradictions; and this Contradiction above-mention'd is not greater than that betwixt _Passive Obedience_, and the _Resistance_ employ'd at the _Revolution_.  A _Tory_, therefore, since the _Revolution_, may be defin'd in a few Words to be _a Lover of Monarchy, tho' without abandoning Liberty; and a Partizan of the Family of_ STUART.  As a _Whig_ may be defin'd to be _a Lover of Liberty, tho' without renouncing Monarchy; and a Friend to the Settlement in the_ PROTESTANT _Line_. THE celebrated Writer above-cited, has asserted, that the REAL Distinction betwixt _Whig_ and _Tory_ was lost at the _Revolution_, and that ever since they have continued to be mere _personal_ Parties, like the _Guelfs_ and _Ghibbellines_, after the Emperors had lost all Authority in _Italy_.  Such an Opinion, were it received, wou'd turn our whole History into an AEnigma; and is, indeed, so contrary to the strongest Evidence, that a Man must have a great Opinion of his own Eloquence to attempt the proving of it.

I SHALL first mention, as an irresistible Proof of a real Distinction betwixt these Parties, what every one may have observ'd or heard concerning the Conduct and Conversation of all his Friends and Acquaintance on both Sides.  Have not the _Tories_ always bore an avowed Affection to the Family of _Stuart_, and have not their Adversaries always opposed with Vigour the Succession of that Family?

THE _Tory_ Principles are confessedly the most favourable to Monarchy.  Yet the _Tories_ have almost always opposed the Court these fifty Years; nor were they cordial Friends to  King _William_, even when employ'd by him.  Their Quarrel, therefore, cannot be supposed to have lain with the Throne, but with the Person who sat on it.

THEY concurr'd heartily with the Court during the four last Years of Queen _Anne_.  But is any one at a Loss to find the Reason?

'TIS monstrous to see an establish'd Episcopal Clergy in declar'd Opposition to the Court, and a Non-conformist Presbyterian Clergy in Conjunction with it.  What can produce such an unnatural Conduct in both?  Nothing, but that the former have espoused Monarchical Principles too high for the present Settlement, which is founded on Principles of Liberty:   And the latter, being afraid of the Prevalence of those high Principles, adhere to that Party, from whom they have Reason to expect Liberty and Toleration.

THE different Conduct of the two Parties, with regard to foreign Politics, is also a Proof to the same Purpose.  _Holland_ has always been most favour'd by one, and _France_ by the other.  In short, the Proofs of this Kind are so  palpable and evident, that one is almost asham'd to collect them.  A _Tory_ is _a Lover of Monarchy, though without abandoning Liberty; and a Partizan of the Family of_ STUART.  A _Whig_ is _a Lover of Liberty, though without renouncing Monarchy; and a Friend to the Settlement in the_ Protestant _Line_.  These different Views, with regard to the Settlement of the Crown, are accidental, but natural Additions to the Principles of the _Court_ and _Country_ Parties, which are the genuine Parties of the _British_ Government.  A passionate Lover of Monarchy is apt to be displeased at any Change of the Succession; as favouring too much of a Commonwealth:  A passionate Lover of Liberty is apt to think that every Part of the Government ought to be subordinate to the Interests of Liberty.  'Tis however remarkable, that though the Principles of _Whig_ and _Tory_ be both of them of a compound Nature; yet the Ingredients, which predominated in both, were not correspondent to each other.  A _Tory_ loved Monarchy, and bore an Affection to the Family of _Stuart_; but the latter Affection was the predominant Inclination of the Party.   A _Whig_ loved Liberty, and was a Friend to the Settlement in the _Protestant_ Line; but the Love of Liberty was professedly his predominant Inclination.  The _Tories_ have frequently acted as Republicans, where either Policy or Revenge has engag'd them to that Conduct; and there were none of that Party, who, upon the Supposition, that they were to be disappointed in their Views with regard to the Succession, would not have desired to impose the strictest Limitations on the Crown, and to bring our Form of Government as near Republican as possible, in order to depress the Family, that, according to their Apprehension, succeeded without any just Title.  The _Whigs_, 'tis true, have also taken Steps dangerous to Liberty, under Colour of securing the Succession and Settlement of the Crown, according to their Views:   But as the Body of the Party had no Passion for that Succession, otherwise than as the Means of securing Liberty, they have been betray'd into these Steps by Ignorance or Frailty, or the Interest of their Leaders.  The Succession of the Crown was, therefore, the chief Point with the _Tories_:  The Security of our Liberties with the _Whigs_. 'TIS Difficult to penetrate into the Thoughts and Sentiments of any particular Man; but 'tis almost impossible to distinguish those of a whole Party, where it often happens, that no two Persons agree precisely in the same Way of thinking.  Yet I will venture to affirm, that it was not so much PRINCIPLE, or an Opinion of indefeazible Right, that attach'd the _Tories_ to the ancient Royal Family, as AFFECTION, or a certain Love and Esteem for their Persons.  The same Cause divided _England_ formerly betwixt the Houses of _York_ and _Lancaster_, and _Scotland_, betwixt the Families of _Bruce_ and _Baliol_; in an Age, when political _Disputes_ were but little in Fashion, and when political _Principles_ must of Course have had but little Influence on Mankind.  The Doctrine of passive Obedience is so absurd in itself, and so opposite to our Liberties, that it seems to have been chiefly left to Pulpit-Declaimers, and to their deluded Followers among the Mob.  Men of better Sense were guided by _Affection_; and as to the Leaders of this Party, 'tis probable, that _Interest_ was their sole Motive, and that they acted more contrary to their private Sentiments, than the Leaders of the opposite Party. SOME, who will not venture to assert, that the _real_ Difference betwixt _Whig_ and _Tory_ was lost at the _Revolution_, seem inclin'd to think, that the Difference is now abolish'd, and that Affairs are so far returned to their natural State, that there are at present no other Parties amongst us but _Court_ and _Country_; that is, Men, who by Interest or Principle are attach'd either to Monarchy or to Liberty.  It must, indeed, be confest, that the _Tory_ Party have, of late, decay'd much in their Numbers; still more in their Zeal; and I may venture to say, still more in their Credit and Authority.  There is no Man of Knowledge or Learning, who wou'd not be asham'd to be thought of that Party; and in almost all Companies the Name of OLD WHIG is mention'd as an uncontestable Appellation of Honour and Dignity.  Accordingly, the Enemies of the Ministry, as a Reproach, call the Courtiers, the true _Tories_; and as an Honour, denominate the Gentlemen in the _Opposition_ the true _Whigs_.  The _Tories_ have been so long oblig'd to talk in the Republican Stile, that they seem to have made Converts of themselves by their Hypocrisy, and to have embrac'd the Sentiments, as well as Language of their Adversaries. There are, however, very considerable Remains of that Party in _England_, with all their old Prejudices; and a demonstrative Proof, that _Court_ and _Country_ are not our only Parties, is, that almost all the Dissenters side with the Court, and the lower Clergy, at least, of the Church of _England_, with the Opposition.  This may convince us, that some Byass still hangs upon our Constitution, some extrinsick Weight, which turns it from its natural Course, and causes a Confusion in our Parties.

I SHALL conclude this Subject with observing, that we never had any _Tories_ in _Scotland_, according to the proper Signification of the Word, and that the Division of Parties in this Country was really into _Whigs_ and _Jacobites_.  A _Jacobite_ seems to be a _Tory_, who has no Regard to the Constitution, but is either a zealous Partizan of absolute Monarchy, or at least willing to sacrifice our Liberties to the obtaining the Succession in that Family to which he is attach'd.  The Reason of the Difference betwixt _England_ and _Scotland_, I take to be this, Our political and our religious Divisions in this Country, have been, since the _Revolution_, regularly correspondent to each other.  The _Presbyterians_ were all _Whigs_ without Exception:  Those who favour'd _Episcopacy_, of the opposite Party.  And as the Clergy of the latter Sect were turn'd out of their Churches at the _Revolution_, they had no Motive for making any Compliances with the Government in their Oaths or Forms of Prayer, but openly avow'd the highest Principles of their Party; which is the Cause, why their Followers have been more bare-fac'd and violent than their Brethren of the _Tory_ Party in _England_.  As violent Things have not commonly so long a Duration as moderate, we actually find, that the _Jacobite_ Party is almost entirely vanish'd from among us, and that the Distinction of _Court_ and _Country_, which is but creeping in at _London_, is the only one that is ever mention'd in this Kingdom.  Beside the Violent and Openness of the _Jacobite_ Party, another Reason has, perhaps, contributed to produce so sudden and so visible an Alteration in this Part of _Britain_.  There are only two Ranks of Men among us; Gentlemen, who have some Fortune and Education, and the meanest slaving Poor; without any considerable Number of that middling Rank  of Men, which abounds more in _England_, both in Cities and in the Country, than in any other Part of the World.  The slaving Poor are incapable of any Principles:  Gentlemen may be converted to true Principles, by Time and Experience:  The middling Rank of Men have Curiosity and Knowledge enough to form Principles, but not enough to form true Ones, or correct any Prejudices that they may have imbib'd:  And 'tis among the middling Rank, that _Tory_ Principles do at present prevail most in _England_.

NOTES

1.  These Words have become of general Use, and therefore I shall employ them, without intending to express by them an universal Blame of the one Party, or Approbation of the other.  The Court-Party may, no doubt, on some Occasions, consult best the Interest of the Country, and the Country-Party oppose it.  In like Manner, the _Roman_ Parties were denominated _Optimates_ and _Populares_; and _Cicero_, like a true Party-Man, defines the _Optimates_ to be such as, in all their publick Conduct, regulated themselves by the Sentiments of the best and worthiest of the _Romans_:  _Pro Sextio_.  The Term of _Country-Party_ may afford a favourable Definition or Etymology of the same Kind:  But it would be Folly to draw any Argument from that Head, and I have no Regard to it in employing these Terms.

2.  This Proposition is true, notwithstanding, that in the early Times of the _English_ Government, the Clergy were the great and principal Opposers of the Crown:  But, at that Time, their Possessions were so immensely great, that they compos'd a considerable Part of the Proprietors of _England_, and in many Contests were direct Rivals of the Crown.

ESSAY XII.

_Of_ SUPERSTITION _and_ ENTHUSIASM.

_THAT the Corruption of the best Things produces the worst_, is grown into a Maxim, and is verify'd, among other Instances, by the pernicious Effects of _Superstition_ and _Enthusiasm_, the Corruptions of true Religion.

THESE two Species of false Religion, tho' both pernicious, yet are of a very different, and even of a contrary Nature.  The Mind of Man is subject to certain unaccountable Terrors and Apprehensions, proceeding either from the unhappy Situation of private or public Affairs, from ill Health, from a gloomy and melancholy Disposition, or from the Concurrence of all these Circumstances.  In such  a State of Mind, infinite unknown Evils are dreaded from unknown Agents; and where real Objects of Terror are wanting, the Soul, active to its own Prejudice, and fostering its predominant Inclination, finds imaginary Ones, to whose Power and Malevolence it sets no Limits.  As these Enemies are intirely invisible and unknown, the Methods taken to appease them are equally unaccountable, and consist in Ceremonies, Observances, Mortifications, Sacrifices, Presents, or in any Practice, however absurd and frivolous, which either Folly or Knavery recommends to a blind and terrify'd Credulity.  Weakness, Fear, Melancholy, along with Ignorance, are, therefore, the true Sources of SUPERSTITION.

BUT the Mind of Man is also subject to an unaccountable Elevation and Presumption, proceeding from prosperous Success, from luxuriant Health, from strong Spirits, or from a bold and confident Disposition.  In such a State of Mind, the Imagination swells with great, but confus'd Conceptions, to which no sublunary Beauties or Enjoyments can correspond.  Every Thing mortal and perishable vanishes as unworthy of Attention.  And a  full Range is given to the Fancy in the invisible Regions or World of Spirits, where the Soul is at Liberty to indulge itself in every Imagination, that may best suit its present Taste and Disposition.  Hence arise Raptures, Transports, and surprizing Flights of Fancy; and Confidence and Presumption still increasing, these Raptures, being altogether unaccountable, and seeming quite beyond the Reach of our ordinary Faculties, are attributed to the immediate Inspiration of that Divine Being who is the Object of Devotion.  In a little Time, the inspir'd Person comes to regard himself as the chief Favourite of the Divinity; and when this Frenzy once takes Place, which is the Summit of Enthusiasm, every Whimsy is consecrated:  Human Reason, and even Morality are rejected as fallacious Guides:  And the fanatick Mad-man delivers himself over, blindly, and without Reserve, to the suppos'd Illapses of the Spirit, and to Inspirations from above.  Hope, Pride, Presumption, a warm Imagination, along with Ignorance, are, therefore, the true Sources of ENTHUSIASM. THESE two Species of false Religion might afford Occasion to many Speculations; but I shall confine myself, at present, to a few Reflections concerning their different Influence on Government and Society.

MY first Reflection is, that Religions, which partake of Enthusiasm are, on their first Rise, much more furious and violent than those which partake of Superstition; but in a little Time become much more gentle and moderate.  The violence of this Species of Religion, when excited by Novelty, and animated by Opposition, appears from numberless Instances; of the _Anabaptists_ in _Germany_, the _Camisars_ in _France_, the _Levellers_ and other Fanaticks in _England_, and the _Covenanters_ in _Scotland_.  As Enthusiasm is founded on strong Spirits, and a presumptuous Boldness of Character, it naturally begets the most extreme Resolutions; especially after it rises to that Height as to inspire the deluded Fanaticks with the Opinion of Divine Illuminations, and with a Contempt of the common Rules of Reason, Morality and Prudence. 'TIS thus Enthusiasm produces the most cruel Desolations in human Society:  But its Fury is like that of Thunder and Tempest, which exhaust themselves in a little Time, and leave the Air more calm and serene than before.  The Reason of this will appear evidently by comparing Enthusiasm to Superstition, the other Species of false Religion; and tracing the natural Consequences of each.  As Superstition is founded on Fear, Sorrow, and a Depression of Spirits, it represents the Person to himself in such despicable Colours, that he appears unworthy, in his own Eyes, of approaching the Divine Presence, and naturally has Recourse to any other Person, whose Sanctity of Life, or, perhaps, Impudence and Cunning, have made him be supposed to be more favoured by the Divinity.  To him the Superstitious entrust their Devotions:  To his Care they recommend their Prayers, Petitions, and Sacrifices:  And, by his Means, hope to render their Addresses acceptable to their incensed Deity.  Hence the Origin of <1> PRIESTS, who may justly be regarded  as one of the grossest Inventions of a timorous and abject Superstition, which, ever diffident of itself, dares not offer up its own Devotions, but ignorantly thinks to recommend itself to the Divinity, by the Mediation of his supposed Friends and Servants.  As Superstition is a considerable Ingredient in almost all Religions, even the most fanatical; there being nothing but Philosophy able to conquer entirely these unaccountable Terrors; hence it proceeds, that in almost every Sect of Religion there are Priests to be found:  But the stronger Mixture there is of Superstition, the higher is the Authority of the Priesthood.  Modern Judaism and Popery, especially the latter, being the most barbarous and absurd Superstitions that have yet been known in the World, are the most enslav'd by their Priests.  As the Church of _England_ may justly be said to retain a strong Mixture of Popish Superstition, it partakes also, in its original Constitution, of a Propensity to Priestly Power and Dominion;  particularly in the Respect it exacts to the Priest.  And tho', according to the Sentiments of that Church, the Prayers of the Priest must be accompanied with those of the Laity; yet is he the Mouth of the Congregation, his Person is sacred, and without his Presence few wou'd think their public Devotions, or the Sacraments, and other Rites, acceptable to the Divinity.

ON the other Hand, it may be observed, that all Enthusiasts have been free from the Yoke of Ecclesiastics, and have exprest a great Independence in their Devotion; with a Contempt of Forms, Traditions and Authorities.  The _Quakers_ are the most egregious, tho', at the same Time, the most innocent, Enthusiasts that have been yet known; and are, perhaps, the only Sect, that have never admitted Priests amongst them.  The _Independents_, of all the _English_ Sectaries, approach nearest to the _Quakers_ in Fanaticism, and in their Freedom from Priestly Bondage.  The _Presbyterians_ follow after, at an equal Distance in both these Particulars.  In short, this Observation is founded on the most certain Experience; and will also appear to be founded on Reason, if we consider,  that as Enthusiasm arises from a presumptuous Pride and Confidence, it thinks itself sufficiently qualified to _approach_ the Divinity, without any human Mediator.  Its rapturous Devotions are so fervent, that it even imagines itself _actually_ to _approach_ him by the Way of Contemplation and inward Converse; which makes it neglect all those outward Ceremonies and Observances, to which the Assistance of the Priests appears so requisite in the Eyes of their superstitious Votaries.  The Fanatick consecrates himself, and bestows on his own Person a sacred Character, much superior to what Forms and ceremonious Institutions can confer on any other.

'TIS therefore an infallible Rule, That Superstition is favourable to Priestly Power, and Enthusiasm as much, or rather more, contrary to it than sound Reason and Philosophy.  The Consequences are evident.  When the first Fire of Enthusiasm is spent, Men naturally, in such fanatical Sects, sink into the greatest Remissness and Coolness in Sacred Matters; there being no Body of Men amongst them, endow'd with sufficient Authority, whose Interest is concerned to support the religious Spirit.  Superstition,  on the contrary, steals in gradually and insensibly; renders Men tame and submissive; is acceptable to the Magistrate, and seems inoffensive to the People:  Till at last the Priest, having firmly establish'd his Authority, becomes the Tyrant and Disturber of human Society, by his endless Contentions, Persecutions, and religious Wars.  How smoothly did the _Romish_ Church advance in their Acquisition of Power?  But into what dismal Convulsions did they throw all _Europe_, in order to maintain it?  On the other Hand, our Sectaries, who were formerly such dangerous Bigots, are now become our greatest Free-thinkers; and the _Quakers_ are, perhaps, the only regular Body of _Deists_ in the Universe, except the _Literati_ or Disciples of _Confucius_ in _China_.

MY second Observation, with regard to these Species of false Religion, is, That Superstition is an Enemy to Civil Liberty, and Enthusiasm a Friend to it.  As Superstition groans under the Dominion of the Priests, and Enthusiasm is destructive of all Ecclesiastical Power, this sufficiently accounts for the present Observation.  Not to mention, that Enthusiasm, being the Infirmity of bold and  ambitious Tempers, is naturally accompanied with a Spirit of Liberty; as Superstition, on the contrary, renders Men tame and abject, and fits them for Slavery.  We learn from the _English_ History, that, during the Civil Wars, the _Independents_ and _Deists_, tho' the most opposite in their religious Principles; yet were united in their political Ones, and were alike passionate for a Commonwealth.  And since the Origin of _Whig_ and _Tory_, the Leaders of the _Whigs_ have either been _Deists_ or profest _Latitudinarians_ in their Principles; that is, Friends to Toleration, and indifferent to any particular Sect of _Christians_:  While the Sectaries, who have all a strong Tincture of Enthusiasm, have always, without Exception, concurr'd with that Party, in the Defence of Civil Liberty.  The Resemblance in their Superstitions long united the High-Church _Tories_ and the _Roman Catholicks_, in the Support of Prerogative and Kingly Power; tho' Experience of the tolerating Spirit of the _Whigs_ seems of late to have reconcil'd the _Catholics_ to that Party.

THE  _Molinists_ and _Jansenists_ in _France_ have a Thousand unintelligible Disputes, which are  not worthy the Attention of a Man of Sense:  But what principally distinguishes these two Sects, and alone merits our Attention, is the different Spirit of their Religion.  The _Molinists_, conducted by the _Jesuites_, are great Friends to Superstition, rigid Observers of external Forms and Ceremonies, and devoted to the Authority of the Priests, and to Tradition.  The _Jansenists_ are Enthusiasts, and zealous Promoters of the passionate Devotion, and of the inward Life; little influenc'd by Authority; and, in a Word, but Half Catholics.  The Consequences are exactly conformable to the foregoing Reasoning.  The _Jesuites_ are the Tyrants and the Slaves of the Court:  And the _Jansenists_ preserve alive the small Sparks of the Love of Liberty, which are to be found in the _French_ Nation.

NOTE

1.  By _Priests_, I here mean only the Pretenders to Power and Dominion, and to a superior Sanctity of Character, distinct from Virtue and good Morals.  These are very different from _Clergymen_, who are set apart, _by the Laws_, to the Care of sacred Matters, and to the conducting our publick Devotions with greater Decency and Order.  There is no Rank of Men more to be respected than the latter.

ESSAY XIV.

_Of the_ DIGNITY _of_ HUMAN NATURE.

THERE are certain Sects, which secretly form themselves in the learned World, as well as in the political; and tho' sometimes they come not to an open Rupture, yet they give a different Turn to the Ways of thinking of those who have taken Party on either Side.  The most remarkable of this Kind are the Sects, that are founded on the different Sentiments with regard to the _Dignity of human Nature_; which is a Point that seems to have divided Philosophers and Poets, as well as Divines, from the Beginning of the World to this Day.  Some exalt our Species to the Skies, and represent Man as a Kind of human Demi-God, that derives his Origin from Heaven, and retains evident  Marks of his Lineage and Descent.  Others insist upon the blind Sides of human Nature, and can discover nothing, except Vanity, in which Man surpasses the other Animals, whom he affects so much to despise.  If an Author possesses the Talent of Rhetorick, and Declamation, he commonly takes Party with the former:  If his Turn lies towards Irony and Ridicule, he naturally throws himself into the other Extreme.

I AM far from thinking, that all those, who have depreciated Human Nature, have been Enemies to Virtue, and have exposed the Frailties of their Fellow-Creatures with any bad Intention.  On the contrary, I am sensible, that a very delicate Sense of Virtue, especially when attended with somewhat of the _Misanthrope_, is apt to give a Man a Disgust of the World, and to make him consider the common Course of Human Affairs with too much Spleen and Indignation.  I must, however, be of Opinion, that the Sentiments of those, who are inclined to think favourably of Mankind, are much more advantageous to Virtue, than the contrary Principles which give us a mean Opinion of our Nature.  When a Man  is possess'd of a high Notion of his Rank and Character in the Creation, he will naturally endeavour to act up to it, and will scorn to do a base or vicious Action, which might sink him below that Figure which he makes in his own Imagination.  Accordingly we find, That all our polite and fashionable Moralists insist upon this Topic, and endeavour to represent Vice as unworthy of Man, as well as odious in itself.

WOMEN are generally much more flatter'd in their Youth than Men; which may proceed from this Reason, among others, that their chief Point of Honour is consider'd as much more difficult than ours, and requires to be supported by all that decent Pride, which can be instill'd into them.

WE find very few Disputes that are not founded on some Ambiguity in the Expression; and I am perswaded, that the present Dispute concerning the Dignity of Human Nature is not more exempt from it than any other.  It may, therefore, be worth while to consider, what is real, and what is only verbal, in this Controversy. THAT there is a natural Difference betwixt Merit and Demerit, Virtue and Vice, Wisdom and Folly, no reasonable Man will deny:  But yet 'tis evident, that in affixing the Term, which denotes either our Approbation or Blame, we are commonly more influenced by Comparison than by any fixt unalterable Standard in the Nature of Things.  In like manner, Quantity, and Extension, and Bulk, are by every one acknowledg'd to be real Things:  But when we call any Animal _great_ or _little_, we always form a secret Comparison betwixt that Animal and others of the same Species; and 'tis that Comparison which regulates our Judgment concerning its Greatness.  A Dog and a Horse may be of the very same Size, while the one is admir'd for the Greatness of its Bulk, and the other for the Smallness.  When I am present, therefore, at any Dispute, I always consider with myself, whether or not it be a Question merely of Comparison that is the Subject of the Dispute; and if it be, whether the Disputants compare the same Objects together, or talk of Things that are widely different.  As the latter is commonly the Case, I have long since learnt to neglect such Disputes  as manifest Abuses of Leisure, the most valuable Present that cou'd be made to Mortals.

IN forming our Notions of Human Nature, we are very apt to make a Comparison betwixt Men and Animals, which are the only Creatures endowed with Thought that fall under our Senses.  Certainly this Comparison is very favourable to Mankind.  On the one Hand we see a Creature, whose Thoughts are not limited by any narrow Bounds, either of Place or Time; who carries his Researches into the most distant Regions of this Globe, and beyond this Globe, to the Planets and Heavenly Bodies; looks backward to consider the first Origin of Human Race; casts his Eyes forward to see the Influence of his Actions upon Posterity, and the Judgments that will be form'd of his Character a thousand Years hence; a Creature, that traces Causes and Effects to a great Length and Intricacy; extracts general Principles from particular Appearances; improves upon his Discoveries; corrects his Mistakes; and makes his very Errors profitable.  On the other hand, we are presented with a Creature the very reverse of this; limited in its Observations and Reasonings to a few sensible Objects  that surround it; without Curiosity, without Foresight; blindly conducted by Instinct, and arriving in a very short Time at its utmost Perfection, beyond which it is never able to advance a single Step.  What a wide Difference is there betwixt these Creatures!  And how exalted a Notion must we entertain of the former, in Comparison of the latter!

THERE are two Means commonly employ'd to destroy this Conclusion:  _First_, By making an unfair Representation of the Case, and insisting only upon the Weaknesses of Human Nature.  And _secondly_, By forming a new and secret Comparison betwixt Man and Beings of the most perfect Wisdom.  Among the other Excellencies of Man, there is this remarkable, that he can form a Notion of Perfections much beyond what he has Experience of in himself; and is not limited in his Conception of Wisdom and Virtue.  He can easily exalt his Notions, and conceive a Degree of Wisdom, which, when compar'd to his own, will make the latter appear very contemptible, and will cause the Difference betwixt that and the Sagacity of Animals, in a manner, to disappear and vanish.  Now this being a Point, in which  all the World is agreed, that Human Understanding falls infinitely short of perfect Wisdom:  'Tis proper we should know when this Comparison takes Place, that we may not dispute, where there is no real Difference in our Sentiments.  Man falls much more short of perfect Wisdom, and even of his own Ideas of perfect Wisdom, than Animals do of Man; but yet the latter Difference is so considerable, that nothing but a Comparison with the former, can make it appear of little Moment.

'TIS also very usual to _compare_ one Man with another; and finding very few that we can call _wise_ or _virtuous_, we are apt to entertain a contemptible Notion of our Species in general.  That we may be sensible of the Fallacy of this Way of Reasoning, we may observe, That the Honourable Appellations of Wise and Virtuous, are not annex'd to any particular Degree of those Qualities of _Wisdom_ and _Virtue_; but arise altogether from the Comparison we make betwixt one Man and another.  When we find a Man, who arrives at such a Pitch of Wisdom as is very uncommon, we pronounce him a wise Man:  So that to  say, there are few wise Men in the World, is really to say nothing; since 'tis only by their Scarcity, that they merit that Appellation.  Were the lowest of our Species as wise as _Tully_, or my Lord _Bacon_, we should still have Reason to say, That there are few wise Men.  For in that Case we should exalt our Notions of Wisdom, and wou'd not pay a singular Honour to any one, that was not singularly distinguish'd by his Talents.  In like Manner, I have heard it observ'd by thoughtless People, that there are few Women possest of Beauty, in Comparison of those who want it; not considering, that we bestow the Epithet of _Beautiful_ only on such as possess a Degree of Beauty, that is common to them with a few.  The same Degree of Beauty in a Woman is call'd Deformity, which is treated as real Beauty in one of our Sex.

AS 'tis usual, in forming a Notion of our Species, to _compare_ it with the other Species above or below it, or to compare the Individuals of the Species among themselves; so we often compare together the different Motives or actuating Principles of Human Nature, in order to regulate our Judgment concerning  it.  And indeed, this is the only Kind of Comparison that is worth our Attention, or decides any Thing in the present Question.  Were the selfish and vicious Principles of Human Nature so much predominant above the social and virtuous, as is asserted by some Philosophers, we ought undoubtedly to entertain a contemptible Notion of Human Nature.  I may, perhaps, treat more fully of this Subject in some future Essay.  In the mean Time, I shall observe, what has been prov'd beyond Question by several great Moralists of the present Age, That the social Passions are by far the most powerful of any, and that even all the other Passions receive from them their chief Force and Influence.  Whoever desires to see this Question treated at large, with the greatest Force of Argument and Eloquence, may consult my Lord _Shaftsbury_'s Enquiry concerning Virtue.

IN my Opinion, there are two Things which have led astray those Philosophers, that have insisted so much on the Selfishness of Man.  In the _first_ Place, they found, that every Act of Virtue or Friendship was  attended with a secret Pleasure:  From whence they  concluded, That Friendship and Virtue could not be disinterested.  But the Fallacy of this is obvious.  The virtuous Sentiment or Passion produces the Pleasure, and does not arise from it.  I feel a Pleasure in doing good to my Friend, because I love him; but do not love him for the sake of that Pleasure.

IN the _second_ Place, it has always been found, that virtuous Men are far from being indifferent to Praise; and therefore they have been represented as a Set of vain-glorious Men, that had nothing in View but the Applauses of others.  But this also is a Fallacy.  'Tis very unjust in the World, when they find any Tincture of Vanity in a laudable Action, to depreciate it upon that Account, or ascribe it entirely to that Motive.  The Case is not the same with Vanity, as with other Passions.  Where Avarice or Revenge enters into any seemingly virtuous Action, 'tis difficult for us to determine how far it enters, and 'tis natural to suppose it the sole actuating Principle.  But Vanity is so nearly ally'd to Virtue, and to love the Fame of virtuous Actions approaches so near the Love of virtuous Actions for their own sake, that these Passions are more capable  of Mixture, than any other kinds of Passion; and 'tis almost impossible to have the latter without some Degree of the former.  Accordingly we find, that this Passion for Glory is always warp'd and varied according to the particular Taste or Sentiment of the Mind on which it falls.  _Nero_ had the same Vanity in driving a Chariot, that _Trajan_ had in governing the Empire with Justice and Ability.  To love the Glory of virtuous Actions is a sure Proof of the Love of virtuous Actions.

ESSAY XV.

_Of_ LIBERTY _and_ DESPOTISM.

THOSE who employ their Pens on political Subjects, free from Party-Rage, and Party-Prejudices, cultivate a Science, which, of all others, contributes most both to public Utility, and to the private Satisfaction of those who addict themselves to the Study of it.  I am apt, however, to entertain a Suspicion, that the World is still too young to fix many general stable Truths in Politics, which will remain true to the latest Posterity.  We have not as yet had Experience of above three thousand Years; so that not only the Art of Reasoning is still defective in this Science, as well as in all others, but we even want sufficient Materials upon which we can reason.  'Tis not fully known, what Degrees of Refinement, either in Virtue or  Vice, human Nature is susceptible of; nor what may be expected of Mankind from any great Revolution in their Education, Customs, or Principles.  _Machiavel_ was certainly a great Genius; but having confin'd his Study to the furious and tyrannical Governments of ancient Times, or the little disorderly Principalities of _Italy_, his Reasonings, especially upon Monarchical Government, have been found extremely defective; and there scarce is any Maxim in his _Prince_, which subsequent Experience has not entirely refuted.  _A weak Prince_, says he, _is incapable of receiving good Counsel; for if he consult with several, he will not be able to choose among their different Counsels.  If he abandon himself to one, that Minister may, perhaps, have Capacity; but he will not be long a Minister:  He will be sure to dispossess his Master, and place himself and his own Family upon the Throne_.  I mention this, among innumerable Instances, of the Errors of that Politician, proceeding, in a great Measure, from his having liv'd in too early an Age of the World, to be a good Judge of political Truth.  Almost all the Princes of _Europe_ are at present govern'd by their Ministers, and have been so for near two Centuries; and yet no such Event  has ever happen'd, or can possibly happen.  _Sejanus_ might project the dethroning the _Caesars_; but _Fleury_, though ever so vicious, could not, while in his Senses, entertain the least Hopes of dispossessing the _Bourbons_.

TRADE was never esteem'd an Affair of State, 'till within the last Century; nor is there any ancient Writer on Politics, who has made mention of it.  Even the _Italians_ have kept a profound Silence with regard to it; though it has now excited the chief Attention, as well of Ministers of State, as of speculative Reasoners.  The great Opulence, Grandeur, and military Atchievements of the two Maritime Powers, seem first to have instructed Mankind in the vast Importance of an extensive Commerce.

HAVING, therefore, intended in this Essay to have made a full Comparison of Liberty and Despotism, and to have shown the Advantages and Disadvantages of each, I began to entertain a Suspicion, that no Man in this Age was sufficiently qualified for such an Undertaking; and that whatever any one should advance on that Head would, in all Probability, be refuted by  further Experience, and be rejected by Posterity.  Such mighty Revolutions have happened in human Affairs, and so many Events have arisen, contrary to the Expectation of the Ancients, as are sufficient to beget the Suspicion of still further Changes.

IT had been observed by the Ancients, That all the Arts and Sciences arose among free Nations; and, That the _Persians_ and _Egyptians_, notwithstanding all their Ease, Opulence and Luxury, made but faint Efforts towards a Relish in those finer Pleasures, which were carried to such Perfection by the _Greeks_, amidst continual Wars, attended with Poverty, and the greatest Simplicity of Life and Manners.  It had also been observ'd, That as soon as the _Greeks_ lost their Liberty, tho' they encreased mightily in Riches, by Means of the Conquests of _Alexander_; yet the Arts, from that Moment, declin'd among them, and have never since been able to raise their Head in that Climate.  Learning was transplanted to _Rome_, the only free Nation at that Time in the Universe; and having met with so favourable a Soil, it made prodigious Shoots for above a Century; till the Decay of Liberty produced  also the Decay of Letters, and spread a total Barbarity over the World.  From these two Experiments, of which each was double in its Kind, and show'd the Fall of Learning in Despotic Governments, as well as its Rise in popular Ones, _Longinus_ thought himself sufficiently justified, in asserting, That the Arts and Sciences could never flourish, but in a free Government:  And in this Opinion, he has been followed by several eminent Writers <1> in our own Country, who either confin'd their View merely to ancient Facts, or entertain'd too great a Partiality in Favour of that Form of Government, which is establish'd amongst us.

BUT what would these Writers have said, to the Instances of modern _Rome_ and of _Florence_?  Of which the former carried to Perfection all the finer Arts of Sculpture, Painting and Music, as well as Poetry, tho' they groan'd under Slavery, and under the Slavery of Priests:  While the latter made the greater Progress in the Arts and Sciences, after they began to lose their Liberty by the Usurpations of the  Family of the _Medicis_.  _Ariosto, Tasso, Galilaeo_, no more than _Raphael_, and _Michael Angelo_, were not born in Republics.  And tho' the _Lombard_ School was famous as well as the _Roman_, yet the _Venetians_ have had the smallest Share in its Honours, and seem rather inferior to the other _Italians_, in their Genius for the Arts and Sciences.  _Rubens_ establish'd his School at _Antwerp_, not at _Amsterdam_; _Dresden_, not _Hamburgh_, is the Centre of Politeness in _Germany_.

BUT the most eminent Instance of the flourishing of Learning in despotic Governments, is that of FRANCE, which never enjoy'd any Shadow of Liberty, and yet has carried the Arts and Sciences nearer Perfection than any other Nation of the Universe.  The _English_ are, perhaps, better Philosophers; the _Italians_ better Painters and Musicians; the _Romans_ were better Orators:  But the _French_ are the only People, except the _Greeks_, who have been at once Philosophers, Poets, Orators, Historians, Painters, Architects, Sculptors and Musicians.  With regard to the Stage, they have far excell'd the _Greeks_:  And, in common Life, have, in a great Measure, perfected  that Art, the most useful and agreeable of any, _l'Art de Vivre_, the Art of Society and Conversation.

IF we consider the State of the Sciences and polite Arts in our own Country, _Horace_'s Observation, with regard to the _Romans_, may, in a great Measure, be applied to the _British_.

/-----Sed in longum tamen aevum

Manserunt, hodieque manent\ vestigia ruris.

THE Elegance and Propriety of Stile have been very much neglected among us.  We have no Dictionary of our Language, and scarce a tolerable Grammar.  The first polite Prose we have, was wrote by a Man <2> who is still alive.  As to _Sprat_, _Temple_ and _Locke_, they knew too little of the Rules of Art to be esteem'd elegant Writers.  The Prose of _Bacon_, _Harrington_ and _Milton_, is altogether stiff and pedantic; tho' their Sense be excellent.  Men, in this Country, have been so much occupied in the Grand Disputes of _Religion_, _Politics_ and _Philosophy_, that they had  no Relish for the minute Observations of Grammar and Criticism.  And tho' this Turn of Thinking must have considerably improv'd our Sense and our Talent of Reasoning beyond those of other Nations; it must be confest, that even in these Sciences, we have not any Standard-Book, which we can transmit to Posterity:  And the utmost we have to boast of, are a few Essays towards a more just Philosophy; which, indeed, promise very much, but have not, as yet, reach'd any Degree of Perfection.

IT has become an establish'd Opinion, That Commerce can never flourish but in a free Government; and this Opinion seems to have been founded on a longer and larger Experience than the foregoing, with Regard to the Arts and Sciences.  If we trace Commerce in its Progress thro' _Tyre, Athens, Syracuse, Carthage, Venice, Florence, Genoa, Antwerp, Holland, England_, &c. we shall always find it to have fixt its Seat in free Governments.  The three greatest trading Towns now in the World, are _London, Amsterdam_, and _Hamburgh_; all free Cities, and Protestant Cities; that is, enjoying a double Liberty.  It must,  however, be observ'd, that the great Jealousy entertain'd of late, with regard to the Commerce of _France_, seems to prove, that this Maxim is no more certain and infallible, than the foregoing, and that the Subjects of absolute Princes may become our Rivals in Commerce, as well as in Learning.

DURST I deliver my Opinion in an Affair of so much Uncertainty, I would assert, That, notwithstanding the Efforts of the _French_, there is something pernicious to Commerce inherent in the very Nature of absolute Government, and inseparable from it:  Tho' the Reason I would assign for this Opinion, is somewhat different from that which is commonly insisted on.  Private Property seems to me fully as secure in a civiliz'd _European_ Monarchy, as in a Republic; nor is any Danger ever apprehended, in such a Government, from the Violence of the Sovereign; no more than we commonly apprehend Danger from Thunder, or Earthquakes, or any Accident the most unusual and extraordinary.  Avarice, the Spur of Industry, is so obstinate a Passion, and works its Way thro' so many real Dangers and Difficulties, that 'tis not likely  it will be scarr'd by an imaginary Danger, which is so small, that it scarce admits of Calculation.  Commerce, therefore, in my Opinion, is apt to decay in absolute Governments, not because it is there less _secure_, but because it is less _honourable_.  A Subordination of Ranks is absolutely necessary to the Support of Monarchy.  Birth, Titles, and Place, must be honour'd above Industry and Riches.  And while these Notions prevail, all the considerable Traders will be tempted to throw up their Commerce, in order to purchase some of those Employments, to which Privileges and Honours are annex'd.

SINCE I am upon this Head of the Alterations that Time has produc'd, or may produce in Politics, I must observe, That all Kinds of Government, free and despotic, seem to have undergone, in modern Times, a great Change to the better, with regard both to foreign and domestic Management.  The _Balance of Power_ is a Secret in Politics known only to the present Age; and I must add, That the internal POLICE of the State has also receiv'd great Improvements within the last Century.  We are inform'd by _Sallust_, That  _Cataline_'s Army was much augmented by the Accession of the Highway-men about _Rome_; tho' I believe, that all of that Profession, who are at present dispers'd over _Europe_, would not amount to a Regiment.  In _Cicero_'s Pleadings for _Milo_, I find this Argument, among others, made Use of to prove, that his Client had not assassinated _Clodius_.  Had _Milo_, says he, intended to have kill'd _Clodius_, he had not attack'd him in the Day-time, and at such a Distance from the City:  He had Way-laid him at Night, near the Suburbs, where it might have been pretended, that he was kill'd by Robbers; and the Frequency of the Accident would have favour'd the Deceit.  This is a surprizing Proof of the loose Police of _Rome_, and of the Number and Force of these Robbers; since _Clodius_, as we learn from the same Oration, was at that Time attended with Sixty Slaves, who were compleatly arm'd, and sufficiently accustom'd to Blood and Danger in the frequent Tumults exacted by that seditious Tribune.

BUT tho' all Kinds of Government be much improv'd in modern Times, yet Monarchical Government seems to have receiv'd the most  considerable Improvements.  It may now be affirm'd of civiliz'd Monarchies, what was formerly said in Praise of Republics alone, _that they are a Government of Laws, not of Men_.  They are found susceptible of Order, Method, and Constancy, to a surprizing Degree.  Property is there secure; Industry encourag'd; the Arts flourish; and the Prince lives secure among his Subjects, like a Father among his Children.  It must, however, be confest, that tho' Monarchical Governments have approach'd nearer to popular Ones, in Gentleness and Stability; yet they are still much inferior.  Our modern Education and Customs instil more Humanity and Moderation than the antient; but have not as yet been able to overcome entirely the Disadvantages of that Form of Government.

BUT here I must beg leave to advance a Conjecture, which seems to me very probable, but which Posterity alone can fully judge of.  I am apt to think, that in Monarchical Governments there is a Source of Improvement, and in Popular Governments a Source of Degeneracy, which in Time will bring these Species of Government still nearer an Equality.   The greatest Abuses, which arise in _France_, the most perfect Model of pure Monarchy, proceed not from the Number or Weight of the Taxes, beyond what are to be met with in free Countries; but from the expensive, unequal, arbitrary, and intricate Method of levying them, by which the Industry of the Poor, especially of the Peasants and Farmers, is, in a great Measure, discourag'd, and Agriculture render'd a beggarly and a slavish Employment.  But to whose Advantage do these Abuses serve?  If to that of the Nobility, they might be esteem'd inherent in that Form of Government; since the Nobility are the true Supports of Monarchy; and 'tis natural their Interest should be more consulted, in such a Constitution, than that of the People.  But the Nobility are, in Reality, the principal Losers by this Oppression; since it ruins their Estates, and beggars their Tenants.  The only Gainers by it are the _Financiers_, a Race of Men despised and hated by the Nobility and the whole Kingdom.  If a Prince or a Minister, therefore, should arise, endow'd with sufficient Discernment to know his own and the public Interest, and with sufficient Force of Mind to break thro' ancient Custom, we might expect to see  these Abuses remedied; in which Case, the Difference betwixt their absolute Government and our free one, would be more nominal than real.

THE Source of Degeneracy, that may be remark'd in free Governments, consists in the Practice of contracting Debt, and mortgaging the public Revenues, by which, Taxes may, in Time, become altogether intolerable, and all the Property of the State be brought into the Hands of the Public.  This Practice is of modern Date.  The _Athenians_, though govern'd by a Republic, paid Twenty _per Cent_. for those Sums of Money, which any emergent Occasion made it necessary for them to borrow; as we learn from _Xenophon_.  Among the Moderns, the _Dutch_ first introduced the Practice of borrowing great Sums at low Interest, and have well nigh ruined themselves by it.  Absolute Princes have also contracted Debt; but as an Absolute Prince may play the Bankrupt when he pleases, his People can never be opprest by his Debts.  In popular Governments, the People, and chiefly those who have the highest Offices, being always the public Creditors, 'tis impossible the State can  ever make use of this Remedy, which, however it may be sometimes necessary, is always cruel and barbarous.  This, therefore, seems to be an Inconvenience, that nearly threatens all free Governments; especially our own, at the present Juncture of Affairs.  And what a strong Motive is this, to increase our Frugality of the public Money; lest, for want of it we be reduced by the Multiplicity of Taxes, to curse our free Government, and wish ourselves in the same State of Servitude with all the Nations that surround us.

ESSAY III.

_Of_ IMPUDENCE _and_ MODESTY.

I HAVE always been of Opinion, That the Complaints against Providence have been ill-grounded, and that the good or bad Qualities of Men are the Causes of their good or bad Fortune, more than what is generally imagined.  There are, no doubt, Instances to the contrary, and pretty numerous ones too; but few, in Comparison of the Instances we have of a right Distribution of Propensity and Adversity:  Nor indeed could it be otherwise from the common Course of human Affairs.  To be endowed with a benevolent Disposition, and to love others will almost infallibly procure Love and Esteem; which is the chief Circumstance in Life, and facilitates every Enterprize and Undertaking; besides the Satisfaction, which immediately results from it.  The Case is much the same with the other Virtues.  Prosperity is naturally, tho' not necessarily attached to Virtue and Merit; and Adversity, in like Manner, to Vice and Folly.

I MUST, however, confess, that this Rule admits of an Exception with regard to one moral Quality; and that _Modesty_ has a natural Tendency to conceal a Man's Talents, as _Impudence_ displays them to the utmost, and has been the only Cause why many have risen in the World, under all the Disadvantages of low Birth and little Merit.  Such Indolence and Incapacity is there in the Generality of Mankind, that they are apt to receive a Man for whatever he has a Mind to put himself off for; and admit his over-bearing Airs as Proofs of that Merit which he assumes to himself.  A decent Assurance seems to be the natural Attendant of Virtue; and few Men can distinguish Impudence from it:  As, on the other Hand, Diffidence, being the natural Result of Vice and Folly, has drawn Disgrace upon Modesty, which in outward Appearance so nearly resembles it. I was lately lamenting to a Friend of mine, who loves a Conceit, That popular Applause should be bestowed with so little Judgement, and that so many empty forward Coxcombs should rise up to a Figure in the World:  Upon which he said there was nothing surprizing in the Case.  _Popular Fame_, says he, _is nothing but Breath or Air; and Air vary naturally presses into a Vacuum_.

AS Impudence, tho' really a Vice, has the same Effects upon a Man's Fortune, as if it were a Virtue; so we may observe, that it is almost as difficult to be attain'd and is, in that respect, distinguish'd from all the other Vices, which are acquired with little Pains, and continually encrease upon Indulgence.  Many a Man, being sensible that Modesty is extremely prejudicial to him in the making his Fortune, has resolved to be impudent, and to put a bold Face upon the Matter:  But, 'tis observable, that such People have seldom succeeded in the Attempt, but have been obliged to relapse into their primitive Modesty.  Nothing carries a Man thro' the World like a true genuine natural Impudence.  Its Counterfeit is good for nothing, nor can ever support itself.  In any other Attempt, whatever Faults a Man commits and is sensible of, he is so much the nearer his End:  But when he endeavours at Impudence, if he ever fail'd in the Attempt, the Remembrance of it will make him blush, and will infallibly disconcert him:  After which every Blush is a Cause for new Blushes, 'till he be found out to be an arrant Cheat, and a vain Pretender to Impudence.

IF any Thing can give a modest Man more Assurance, it must be some Advantages of Fortune, which Chance procures to him.  Riches naturally gain a Man a favourable Reception in the World, and give Merit a double Lustre, when a Person is endowed with it; and supply its Place, in a great Measure, when it is absent.  'Tis wonderful to observe what Airs of Superiority Fools and Knaves, with large Possessions, give themselves above Men of the greatest Merit in Poverty.  Nor do the Men of Merit make any strong Opposition to these Usurpations; or rather seem to favour them by the Modesty of their Behavior.  Their Good Sense and Experience make them diffident of their Judgment, and cause them to examine every Thing with the greatest Accuracy: AS, on the other Hand, the Delicacy of their Sentiments makes them timorous lest they commit Faults, and lose in the Practice of the World that Integrity of Virtue, of which they are so jealous.  To make Wisdom agree with Confidence, is as difficult as to reconcile Vice to Modesty.

THESE are the Reflections that have occur'd to me upon this Subject of Impudence and Modesty; and I hope the Reader will not be displeased to see them wrought into the following Allegory.

JUPITER, in the Beginning, joined VIRTUE, WISDOM and CONFIDENCE together; and VICE, FOLLY, and DIFFIDENCE:  And in that Society set them upon the Earth.  But though he thought he had matched them with great Judgment, and said that _Confidence_ was the natural Companion of _Virtue_, and that _Vice_ deserved to be attended with _Diffidence_, they had not gone far before Dissention arose among them.  _Wisdom_, who was the Guide of the one Company, was always accustomed, before she ventured upon any Road, however beaten, to examine it carefully; to enquire whither it led; what Dangers, Difficulties and Hindrances might possibly or probably occur in it.  In these Deliberations she usually consum'd some Time; which Delay was very displeasing to _Confidence_, who was always inclin'd to hurry on, without much Forethought or Deliberation, in the first Road he met.  _Wisdom_ and _Virtue_ were inseparable:  But _Confidence_ one Day, following his impetuous Nature, advanc'd a considerable Way before his Guides and Companions; and not seeing any Want of their Company, he never enquir'd after them, nor ever met with them more.  In like manner, the other Society, tho' join'd by _Jupiter_, disagreed and separated.  As _Folly_ saw very little Way before her, she had nothing to determine concerning the Goodness of Roads, nor cou'd give the Preference to one above another; and his Want of Resolution was encreas'd by _Diffidence_, who, with her Doubts and Scruples, always retarded the Journey.  This was a great Annoyance to _Vice_, who lov'd not to hear of Difficulties and Delays, and was never satisfy'd without his full Career, in whatever his Inclinations led him to.  _Folly_, he knew, tho' she hearken'd to _Diffidence_, wou'd be easily manag'd when alone; and therefore, as a vicious Horse throws his Rider, he openly beat away this Controller of all his pleasures, and proceeded in his Journey with _Folly_, from whom he is inseparable.  _Confidence_ and _Diffidence_ being, after this Manner, both thrown loose from their respective Companies, wander'd for some Time; till at last Chance led them at the same Time to one Village.  _Confidence_ went directly up to the Great House, which belong'd to WEALTH, the Lord of the Village; and without staying for a Porter, intruded himself immediately into the innermost Apartments, where he found _Vice_ and _Folly_ well receiv'd before him.  He join'd the Train; recommended himself very quickly to his Landlord; and entr'd into such Familiarity with _Vice_, that he was enlisted in the same Company along with _Folly_.  They were frequent Guests of _Wealth_, and from that Moment inseparable.  _Diffidence_, in the mean Time, not daring to approach the Great House, accepted of an Invitation from POVERTY, one of the Tenants; and entering the Cottage, found _Wisdom_ and _Virtue_, who being repuls'd by the Land-lord had retir'd thither.  _Virtue_ took Compassion of her, and _Wisdom_ found, from her Temper, that she wou'd easily improve:  So they admitted her into their Society.  Accordingly, by their Means, she alter'd in a little Time somewhat of her Manner, and becoming much more amiable and engaging, was now call'd by the Name of MODESTY.  As ill Company has a greater Effect than good, _Confidence_, tho' more refractory to Counsel and Example, degenerated so far by the Society of _Vice_ and _Folly_, as to pass by the Name of IMPUDENCE.  Mankind, who saw these Societies as _Jupiter_ first join'd them, and know nothing of these mutual Desertions, are led in-into strange Mistakes by those Means; and wherever they see _impudence_, make account of _Virtue_ and _Wisdom_, and wherever they observe _Modesty_ call her Attendants _Vice_ and _Folly_.

ESSAY VI.

_Of_ LOVE _and_ Marriage.

I KNOW not whence it proceeds, that Women are so apt to take amiss every Thing that is said in Disparagement of the married State; and always consider a Satyr upon Matrimony as a Satyr upon themselves.  Do they mean this, that they are the parties principally concerned, and that if a Backwardness to enter into that State should prevail in the World, they would be the greatest Sufferers?  Or, are they sensible, that the Misfortunes and Miscarriages of the married State are owing more to their Sex than to ours?  I hope they do not intend to confess either of these two Particulars, or give such an Advantage to their Adversaries, the Men, as even to allow them to suspect it. I HAVE often had Thoughts of complying with this Humour of the Fair Sex, and of writing a Panegyric upon Marriage:  But, in looking around for Materials, they seem'd to be of so mix'd a Nature, that at the Conclusion of my Reflections, I found I was as much dispos'd to write a Satyr, which might be plac'd on the opposite Pages of my Panegyric:  And I am afraid, that as Satyr is, on most occasions, thought to have more Truth in it than Panegyric, I shou'd have done their Cause more Harm than Good by this Expedient.  To misrepresent Facts is what, I know, they will not require of me.  I must be more of a Friend to Truth, than even to them, where their Interests are opposite.

I SHALL tell the Women what it is our Sex complains of most in the married State; and if they be disposed to satisfy us in this Particular, all the other Differences will be easily accommodated.  If I be not mistaken, 'tis their Love of Dominion which is the Ground of the Quarrel; tho' tis very likely, that they will think it an unreasonable Love of it in us, which makes us insist so much upon that Point.  However this may be, no Passion seems to have more Influence on female Minds, than this for Power; and there is a remarkable Instance in History of its prevailing above another Passion, which is the only one that can be supposed a proper Counter-poise for it.  We are told, that all the Women in _Scythia_ once conspired against the Men, and kept the Secret so well, that they executed their Design before they were suspected.  They surprised the Men in Drink, or asleep, bound them all fast in Chains; and having called a solemn Council of the whole Sex, it was debated what Expedient should be used to improve the present Advantage, and prevent their falling again into Slavery.  To kill all the Men did not seem to the Relish of any Part of the Assembly notwithstanding the Injuries formerly receiv'd; and they were afterwards pleased to make a great Merit of this Lenity of theirs.  It was, therefore, agreed to put out the Eyes of the whole male Sex, and thereby resign for ever, after all, the Vanity they could draw from their Beauty, in order to secure their Authority.  We must no longer pretend to Dress and Show, say they; but then we shall be free from Slavery.  We shall hear no more tender Sighs; but in return we shall hear no more imperious Commands.  Love must for ever leave us; but he will carry Subjection along with him.

'TIS regarded by some as an unlucky Circumstance, since the Women were resolved to maim the Men, and deprive them of some of their Senses, in order to render them humble and dependent, that the Sense of Hearing could not serve their Purpose, since 'tis probable the Females would rather have attack'd that than the Sight:  And I think it is agreed among the Learned, that, in a married State, 'tis not near so great an Inconvenience to lose the former Sense as the latter.  However this may be, we are told by modern Anecdotes, that some of the _Scythian_ Women did secretly spare their Husbands eyes; presuming, I suppose, that they could govern them as well by Means of that Sense as without it.  But so incorrigible and intractable were these men, that their Wives were all obliged, in a few Years, as their Youth and Beauty decay'd, to imitate the Example of their Sisters; which it was no difficult Matter to do in a State where the female Sex had once got the Superiority. I KNOW not if our _Scottish_ Ladies derive any Thing of this Humour from their _Scythian_ Ancestors; but, I must confess, that I have often been surpriz'd to see a Woman very well pleas'd to take a Fool for her Mate, that she might govern with the less Controul; and cou'd not but think her Sentiments, in this Respect, still more barbarous than those of the _Scythian_ Women above mentioned, as much, as the Eyes of the Understanding are more valuable than those of the Body.

BUT to be just, and to lay the Blame more equally, I am afraid it is the Fault of our Sex, if the Women be so fond of Rule, and that if we did not abuse our Authority, they wou'd never think it worth while to dispute it.  Tyrants, we know, produce Rebels; and all History informs us that Rebels, when they prevail, are apt to become Tyrants in their Turn.  For this Reason, I cou'd wish there were no Pretensions to Authority on either Side; but that every Thing was carry'd on with perfect Equality, as betwixt two equal Members of the same Body.  And to induce both Parties to embrace those amicable Sentiments, I shall deliver to them _Plato_'s Account of the Origin of Love and Marriage.

MANKIND, according to that fanciful Philosopher, were not, in their Original, divided into Male and Female, as at present; but each individual Person was a Compound of both Sexes, and was in himself both Husband and Wife, melted down into one living Creature.  This Union, no Doubt, was very entire, and the Parts very well adjusted together, since there resulted a perfect Harmony betwixt the Male and Female, altho' they were oblig'd to be inseparable Companions.  And so great was the Harmony and Happiness flowing from it, that the ADNDROGYNES (for so _Plato_ calls them) or MEN-WOMEN, became insolent upon their Prosperity, and rebell'd against the Gods.  To punish them for this Temerity, _Jupiter_ cou'd contrive no better Expedient, than to divorce the Male-Part from the Female, to make two imperfect Beings of the Compound, which was before so perfect.  Hence the Origin of Men and Women, as distinct Creatures.  But notwithstanding this Division, so lively is our Remembrance of the Happiness we enjoy'd in our primaeval State, that we are never at Rest in this Situation; but each of these Halves is continually searching thro' the whole Species to find the other Half, which was broken from it:  And when they meet, they join again with the greatest Fondness and Sympathy.  But it often happens, that they are mistaken in this Particular; that they take for their Half what no way corresponds to them; and that the Parts do not meet nor join in with each other, as is usual in Fractures.  In this Case the Union is soon dissolv'd, and each Part is set loose again to hunt for its lost Half, joining itself to every one it meets by Way of Trial, and enjoying no Rest, till its perfect Sympathy with its Partner shews, that it has at last been successful in its Endeavours.

WERE I dispos'd to carry on this Fiction of _Plato_, which accounts for the mutual Love betwixt the Sexes in so agreeable a Manner, I wou'd do it by the following Allegory.

WHEN _Jupiter_ had separated the Male from the Female, and had quell'd their Pride and Ambition by so severe an Operation, he cou'd not but repent him of the Cruelty of his Vengeance, and take Compassion on poor Mortals, who were now become incapable of any Repose or Tranquility.  Such Cravings, such Anxieties, such Necessities arose, as made them curse their Creation, and think Existence itself a punishment.  In vain had they Recourse to every other Occupation and Amusement.  In vain did they seek after every Pleasure of Sense, and every Refinement of Reason.  Nothing cou'd fill that Void, which they felt in their Hearts, or supply the Loss of their Partner, who was so fatally separated from them.  To remedy this Disorder, and to bestow some Comfort, at least, on human Race in their forelorn Situation, _Jupiter_ sent down LOVE and HYMEN to collect the broken Halves of human Kind, and piece them together, in the best Manner possible.  These two Deities found such a prompt Disposition in Mankind to unite again in their primitive State, that they proceeded on their Work with wonderful Success for some Time; till at last, from many unlucky Accidents, Dissention arose betwixt them.  The chief Counsellor and Favourite of _Hymen_ was CARE, who was continually filling his Patron's head with Prospects of Futurity; a Settlement, Family, Children, Servants; so that little else was regarded in all the Matches _they_ made.  On the other Hand, _Love_ had chosen _Pleasure_ for his Favourite, who was as pernicious a Counsellor as the other, and wou'd never allow _Love_ to look beyond the present momentary Gratification, or the satisfying of the prevailing Inclination.  These two favourites became, in a little Time, irreconcileable Enemies, and made it their chief Business to undermine each other in all their Undertakings.  No sooner had _Love_ fixt upon two Halves, which he was cementing together, and forming to a close Union, but _Care_ insinuates himself, and bringing _Hymen_; and calling _Love_ to his Assistance, they Under-hand contrive to join each Half, by secret Links, to Halves, which _Hymen_ was wholly unacquainted with.  It was not long before this Quarrel was felt in its pernicious Consequences; and such Complaints arose before the Throne of _Jupiter_, that he was oblig'd to summon the offending Parties to appear before him, in order to give an Account of their Proceedings.  After hearing the Pleadings on both sides, he order'd an immediate Reconcilement betwixt _Love_ and _Hymen_, as the only Expedient for giving Happiness to Mankind:  And that he might be sure this Reconcilement shou'd be durable, he laid his strict Injunctions on them never to join any Halves without consulting their Favourites, _Care_ and _Pleasure_, and obtaining the Consent of both to the Conjunction.  Where this order is strictly observ'd, the _Androgyne_ is perfectly restor'd, and human Race enjoy the same Happiness as in their primaeval State.  The Seam is scarce perceiv'd that joins the two Beings together; but both of them combine to form one perfect and happy Creature.

ESSAY VII.

_Of the_ STUDY _of_ HISTORY.

THERE is nothing I would recommend more earnestly to my female Readers than the Study of History, as an Occupation, of all others, the best suited both to their Sex and Education; much more instructive than their ordinary Books of Amusement, and more entertaining than those serious Compositions, which are usually to be found in their Closets.  Among other important Truths, which they may learn rom History, they may be informed of two Particulars, the Knowledge of which may contribute very much to their Quiet and Repose; _That_ our Sex, as well as theirs, are far from being such perfect Creatures as they are apt to imagine, and, _That_ Love in not the only Passion, that governs the Male-World, but is often overcome by Avarice, Ambition, Vanity, and a thousand other Passions.  Whether they be the false Representations of Mankind in those two Particulars, that endear Romances and Novels so much to the fair Sex, I know not; but must confess, I am sorry to see them have such an Aversions to Matter of Fact, and such an Appetite for Falsehood.  I remember I was once desired by a young Beauty, for whom I had some Passion, to send her some Novels and Romances for her Amusement in the Country; but was not so ungenerous as to take the Advantage, which such a Course of Reading might have given me, being resolved not to make Use of poisoned Arms against her.  I therefore sent her _Plutarch_'s Lives, assuring her, at the same Time, That there was not a Word of Truth in them from Beginning to End.  She perused them very attentively, 'till she came to the Lives of _Alexander_ and _Caesar_, whose Names she had heard of by Accident: and then returned me the Book, with many Reproaches for deceiving her.

I MAY indeed be told, that the fair Sex have no such Aversion to History, as I have represented, provided it be _secret_ History, and contain some remarkable Transaction proper to excite their Curiosity.  But as I do not find that Truth, which is the Basis of History, is at all regarded in those Anecdotes, I cannot admit of this as a Proof of their Passion for that Study.  However this may be, I see not why the same Curiosity might not receive a more proper Direction, and lead them to desire Accounts of those who lived in past Ages as well as of their Contemporaries.  What is it to _Cleora_, whether _Fulvia_ entertains a secret Commerce of Love with _Philander_ or not?  Has she not equal Reason to be pleased, when she is informed, (what is whispered about a-among Historians) that _Cato_'s Sister had an Intrigue with _Caesar_, and palmed her Son, _Marcus Brutus_, upon her Husband for his own, tho' in Reality, he was her Gallant's?  And are not the Loves of _Messalina_ of _Julia_ as proper Subjects of Discourse as any Intrigue that this City has produced of late Years.

BUT I know not whence it comes, that I have been thus seduc'd into a Kind of Raillery against the Ladies:  Unless, perhaps, it proceed from the same Cause, that makes the Person, who is the Favourite of the Company,  be often the Object of their good-natur'd Jests and Pleasantries.  We are pleased to address ourselves after any Manner to a Person that is agreeable to us; and, at the same Time, presume, that nothing will be taken amiss by one who is secure of the good Opininion and Affections of every one present.  I shall now proceed to handle my Subject more seriously, and shall point out the many Advantages, that flow from the Study of History, and show how well suited it is to every one, but particularly to those who are debarred the severer Studies, by the Tenderness of their Complexion, and the Weakness of their Education.  The Advantages found in History seem to be of three Kinds, as it amuses the Fancy, as it improves the Understanding, and as it strengthens Virtue.

IN Reality, what more agreeable Entertainment to the Mind, than to be transported into the remotest Ages of the World, and to observe human Society, in its Infancy, making the first faint Essays towards the Arts and Sciences:  To see the Policy of Government, and the Civility of Conversation refining by Degrees, and every Thing that is ornamental to human life advancing towards its Perfection.  To remark the Rise, Progress, Declension and Final Extinction of the most flourishing Empires:  The Virtues, which contributed to their Greatness; and the Vices, which drew on their Ruin.  In short, to see all human Race, from the Beginning of Time, pass, as it were, in Review before us, appearing in their true Colours, without any of those Disguises, which, during their Lifetime, so much perplexed the Judgments of the Beholders.  What Spectacle can be imagined so magnificent, so various, so interesting?  What Amusement, either of the Senses or Imagination, can be compared with it?  Shall those trifling Pastimes, which engross so much of our Time, be preferr'd as more satisfactory, and more fit to engage our Attention?  How perverse must the Taste be, which is capable of so wrong a Choice of Pleasures?

BUT History is a most improving Part of Knowledge, as well as an agreeable Amusement; and indeed, a great Part of what we commonly call _Erudition_, and value so highly, is nothing but an Acquaintance with historical Facts.  An extensive Knowledge of this kind belongs to Men of Letters; but I must think it an unpardonable Ignorance in Persons of whatever Sex or Condition, not to be acquainted with the History of their own Country, along with the Histories of ancient _Greece_ and _Rome_.  A Woman may behave herself with good Manners, and have even some Vivacity in her Turn of Wit; but where her Mind is so unfurnish'd, 'tis impossible her Conversation can afford any Entertainment to Men of Sense and Reflection.

I MUST add, That History is not only a valuable Part of Knowledge, but opens the Door to many other Parts of Knowledge, and affords Materials to most of the Sciences.  And indeed, if we consider the Shortness of human Life, and our limited Knowledge, even of what passes in our own Time, we must be sensible, that we should be for ever Children in Understanding, were it not for this Invention, which extends our Experience to all past Ages, and to the most distant Nations, making them contribute as much to our Improvement in Wisdom, as if they had actually lain under our Observation.  A Man acquainted with History may, in some respect,  be said to have lived from the Beginning of the World, and to have been making continual Additions to his Stock of Knowledge in every Century.

THERE is also an Advantage in that Knowledge which is acquired by History, above what is learned by the Practice of the World, that it brings us acquainted with human Affairs, without diminishing in the least from the most delicate Sentiments of Virtue.  And, to tell the truth, I know not any study or Occupation so unexceptional as History in this particular.  Poets can paint Virtue in the most charming Colours; but, as they address themselves entirely to the Passions, they often become Advocates for Vice.  Even Philosophers are apt to bewilder themselves in the Subtilty of their Speculations; and we have seen some go so far as to deny the Reality of all moral Distinctions.  But I think it a Remark worthy the Attention of the speculative Reader, that the Historians have been, almost without Exception, the true Friends of Virtue, and have always represented it in its proper Colours, however they may have erred in their Judgements of particular Persons.  _Machiavel_ himself discovers a true Sentiment of Virtue in his History of _Florence_.  When he talks as a _Politician_, in his general Reasonings, he considers Poisoning, Assassination and Perjury as lawful Arts of Power; but when he speaks as an _Historian_, in his particular Narrations, he shows so keen an Indignation against Vice, and so warm an Approbation of Virtue, in many Passages, that I could not forebear applying to him that Remark of _Horace_, That if you chase away Nature, though with never so great Indignity, she will always return upon you.  Nor is this combination of Historians in Favour of Virtue at all difficult to be accounted for.  When a Man of Business enters into Life and Action, he is more apt to consider the Characters of Men, as they have relation to his interest, than as they stand in themselves; and has his Judgement warped on every Occasion by the Violence of his Passion.  When a Philosopher contemplates Characters and Manners in his Closet, the general abstract View of the Objects leaves the Mind so cold and unmoved, that the Sentiments of Nature have no Room to play, and he scarce feels the Difference betwixt Vice and Virtue.  History keeps in a just Medium betwixt these Extremes, and paces the Objects in their true Point of View.  The Writers of History, as well as the Readers, are sufficiently interested in the Characters and Events, to have a lively Sentiment of Blame or Praise; and, at the same Time, have no particular Interest or Concern to pervert their Judgement.

ESSAY XIII.

_Of_ AVARICE.

'TIS easy to observe, That Comic Writers exaggerate every Character, and draw their Fop, or Coward, with stronger Features than are any where to be met with in Nature.  This moral Kind of Painting for the Stage has been often compar'd to the Painting for Cupolas and Ceilings, where the Colours are overcharg'd, and every Part is drawn excessively large, and beyond Nature.  The Figures seem monstrous and disproportion'd, when seen too nigh; but become natural and regular, when set at a Distance, and placed in that Point of View, in which they are intended to be survey'd.  After the same Manner, when Characters are exhibited in theatrical Representations, the Want of Reality sets the Personages at a Distance from us; and rendering them more cold and unentertaining, makes it necessary to compensate, by the Force of Colouring, what they want in Substance.  Thus, we find in common Life, That when a Man once allows himself to depart from Truth in his Narrations, he never can keep within the Bounds of Probability; but adds still some new Circumstance to render his Stories more marvellous, and to satisfy his Imagination.  Two Men in Buckram Suits became eleven to Sir _John Falstaff_ before the End of his Story.

THERE is only one Vice, which may be found in Life with as strong Features, and as high a Colouring, as need be employ'd by any Satyrist or Comic Poet; and that is AVARICE.  Every Day we meet with Men of immense Fortunes, without Heirs, and on the very Brink of the Grave, who refuse themselves the most common Necessaries of Life, and go on heaping Possessions on Possessions, under all the real Pressures of the severest Poverty.  An old Usurer, says the Story, lying in his vast Agonies, was presented by the Priest with the Crucifix to worship.  He opens his Eyes a Moment before he expires, considers the Crucifix, and cries, _These Jewels are not true; I can only lend ten Pistoles upon such a Pledge_.  This was probably the Invention of some Epigrammatist; and yet every one, from his own Experience, may be able to recollect almost as strong Instances of Perseverance in Avarice, 'Tis commonly reported of a famous Miser in this City, that finding himself near Death, he sent for some of the Magistrates, and gave them a Bill of an hundred Pounds, payable after his Decease; which Sum he intended should be disposed of in charitable Uses; but scarce were they gone, when he ordered them to be called back, and offers them ready Money, if they would abate five Pounds of the Sum.  Another noted miser in the North, intending to defraud his Heirs, and leave his Fortune to the Building an Hospital, protracted the drawing of his Will from Day to Day; and 'tis thought, that if those interested in it had not paid for the Drawing of it, he had died intestate.  In short, none of the most furious Excesses of Love and Ambition are in any respect to be compared to the Extremes of Avarice. THE best Excuse that can be made for Avarice is, That it generally prevails in old Men, or in Men of cold Tempers, where all the other Affections are extinct; and the Mind being incapable of remaining without some Passion or Pursuit, at last finds out this monstrous unreasonable one, which suits the Coldness and Inactivity of its Temper.  At the same Time, it seems very extraordinary, that so frosty spiritless a Passion shou'd be able to carry us farther than all the Warmth of Youth and Pleasure.  But if we look more narrowly into the Matter, we shall find, that this very Circumstance renders the Explication of the Case more easy.  When the Temper is warm, and full of Vigour, it naturally shoots out more Ways than one, and produces inferior Passions to counter-balance, in some Degree, its predominant Inclination.  'Tis impossible for a Person of that Temper, however bent on any Pursuit, to be depriv'd of all Sense of Shame, or Regard to the Sentiments of Mankind.  His Friends must have some Influence over him:  And other Considerations are apt to have their Weight.  All this serves to restrain him within some Bounds.  But 'tis no Wonder the avaritious Man being, from the Coldness of his Temper, without regard to Reputation, to Friendship, or to Pleasure, shou'd be carried so far by his prevailing Inclination, and shou'd display his Passion in such surprizing Instances.

ACCORDINGLY we find no Vice so irreclaimable as Avarice:  And tho' there scarcely has been a Moralist of Philosopher, from the Beginning of the World to this Day, who has not levell'd a Stroke at it, we hardly find a single Instance of any Person's being cur'd of it.  For this Reason, I am more apt to approve of those, who attack it with Wit and Humour, than of those who treat it in a serious Manner.  There being so little Hopes of doing Good to the People infected with this Vice, I would have the rest of Mankind, at least, diverted by our Manner of exposing it:  As indeed there is no Kind of Diversion, of which they seem so willing to partake.

AMONG the Fables of _Monsieur de la Motte_, there is one levell'd against Avarice, which seems to me more natural and easy, than most of the Fables of that ingenious Author.  A Miser, says he, being dead, and fairly interred, came to the Banks of the _Styx_, desiring to be ferry'd over along with the other Ghosts.  _Charon_ demands his Fare, and is surpriz'd to see the Miser, rather than pay it, throw himself into the River, and swim over to the other Side, notwithstanding all the Clamour and Opposition that cou'd be made to him.  All Hell was in an Uproar; and each of the Judges was meditating some Punishment, suitable to a Crime of such dangerous Consequence to the internal Revenues.  Shall he be chain'd to the Rock along with _Prometheus_?  Or tremble below the Precipice in Company with the _Danaides_?  Or assist _Sisyphus_ in rolling his Stone?  No, says _Minos_, None of these.  We must invent some severer Punishment.  Let him be sent back to the Earth, to see the Use his Heirs are making of his Riches.

I HOPE it will not be interpreted as a Design of setting myself in Opposition to this famous Author, if I proceed to deliver a Fable of my own, which is intended to expose the same Vice of Avarice.  The Hint of it was taken from these Lines of Mr. _pope_,

/Damn'd to the Mines, an equal Fate betides

The Slave that digs it, and the Slave that hides\. OUR old Mother EARTH once laid an Indictment against AVARICE before the Courts of Heaven, for her wicked and malicious Counsel and Advice, in tempting, inducing, persuading, and traiterously seducing the Children of the Plaintiff to commit the detestable Crime of Parricide upon her, and, mangling her Body, ransack her very Bowels for hidden Treasure.  The Indictment was very long and verbose; but we must omit a great Part of the Repetitions and Synonimous Terms, not to tire our Reader too much with our Tale.  _Avarice_, being call'd before _Jupiter_ to answer to this Charge, had not much to say in her own Defence.  The Injury was clearly prov'd upon her.  The Fact, indeed, was notorious, and the Injury had been frequently repeated.  When therefore the Plaintiff demanded Justice, _Jupiter_ very readily gave Sentence in her Favour; and his Decree was to this Purpose, That since Dame _Avarice_, the Defendant, had thus grievously injur'd Dame _Earth_, the Plaintiff, she was hereby order'd to take that Treasure, of which she had feloniously robb'd the said Plaintiff, by ransacking her Bosom, and in the same Manner, as before, opening her Bosom, restore it back to her, without Diminution or Retention.  From this Sentence, it shall follow, says _Jupiter_ to the By-standers, That, in all future Ages, the Retainers of _Avarice_ shall bury and conceal their Riches, and thereby restore to the _Earth_ what they took from her.

ESSAY II.

_Of_ ELOQUENCE.

THOSE, who consider the Periods and Revolutions of human Kind, as represented in History, are entertain'd with a Spectacle full of Pleasure and Variety, and see, with Surprize, the Manners, Customs, and Opinions of the same Species susceptible of such prodigious Changes in different Periods of Time.  It may, however, be observ'd, That in _civil_ History there is found a much greater Uniformity than in the History of Learning and Science, and that the Wars, Negotiations and Politics of one Age resemble more those of another, than the Taste, Wit, and speculative Principles.  Interest and Ambition, Honour and Shame, Friendship and Enmity, Gratitude and Revenge, are the prime Movers in all public Transactions; and these Passions are of a very stubborn and intractable Nature, in Comparison of the Sentiments and Understanding, which are easily varied

by Education and Example.  The _Goths_ were much more inferior to the _Romans_, in Taste and Science, than in Courage and Virtue.

BUT not to compare together Nations so widely different, that they may almost be esteem'd of a different Species; it may be observ'd, That even this latter Period of human Learning, is, in many Respects, considerably different from the antient; and that if we be superior in Philosophy, we are still, notwithstanding all our Refinements, much inferior in Eloquence.

IN antient Times, no Performance was thought to require so great Genius and Capacity, as that of speaking in Public; and some eminent Writers have pronounc'd the Talents, even of a great Poet or Philosopher, to be of an inferior Nature to those requisite for such an Undertaking.  _Greece_ and _Rome_ produc'd, each of them, but one accomplish'd Orator; and whatever Praises the other celebrated Speakers might merit, they were still esteem'd much inferior to those two great Heroes of Eloquence.  'Tis observable, That the antient Critics could scarce find two Orators, in any

Age, that deserv'd to be plac'd precisely in the same Rank, and possess'd the same Degree of Merit.  _Calvus_, _Caelius_, _Curio_, _Hortensius_, _Caesar_ rose one above another:  But the greatest of that Age was inferior to _Cicero_, the most eloquent Speaker that had ever appear'd in _Rome_.  Those of fine Taste, however, pronounc'd this Judgment of the _Roman_ Orator, as well as of the _Grecian_, that both of them surpass'd in Eloquence all that had ever appear'd, but that they were far from reaching the Perfection of their Art, which was infinite, and not only exceeded human Force to attain, but also human Imagination to conceive.  _Cicero_ declares himself dissatisfy'd with his own Performances; nay, even with those of _Demosthenes_.  _Ita sunt avidae & capaces meae aures_, says he, _& semper aliquid immensum, infinitumque desiderant_.

THESE Circumstances alone are sufficient to make us apprehend the wide Difference betwixt antient and modern Eloquence, and let us see how much the latter is inferior to the former.  Of all the polite and learned Nations, _Britain_ alone possesses a popular Government, or admits into the Legislature such numerous

Assemblies as can be suppos'd to lye under the Dominion of Eloquence.  But what has _Britain_ to boast of in this Particular?  In enumerating all the great Men, that have done Honour to our Country, we exult in our Poets and Philosophers:  But what Orators are ever mention'd?  Or where are the Monuments of their Genius to be met with?  There are found, indeed, in our Histories the Names of several, who directed the Resolutions of our Parliament:  But neither themselves nor others have taken the Pains to preserve their Speeches; and the Authority they possess'd seems to have been owing to their Experience, Wisdom, or Power, more than to their Talents for Oratory.  At present, there are above half a dozen Speakers in the two Houses, who, in the Judgment of the Public, have reach'd very near the same Pitch of Eloquence; and no Man pretends to give any one the Preference to the rest.  This seems to me a certain Proof, that none of them have attain'd much beyond a Mediocrity in their Art, and that the Species of Eloquence they aspire to, gives no Exercise to the sublimer Faculties of the Mind, but may be reach'd by ordinary Talents and a slight Application.  A hundred Cabinet-makers in

_London_ can work a Table or a Chair equally well; but no one Poet can write Verses with such Spirit and Elegance as Mr. _Pope_.

WE are told, that when _Demosthenes_ was to plead, all the ingenious Men flock'd to _Athens_ from the most remote Parts of _Greece_, as to the most celebrated Spectacle of the World <1>.  At _London_, you may see Men sauntering in the Court of Requests, while the most important Debate is carrying on in the two Houses; and many do not think themselves sufficiently compensated, for the losing of their Dinners, by all the Eloquence of our most celebrated Speakers.  When old _Cibber_ is to act, the Curiosity of the Public is more excited, than when our prime Minister is to defend himself from a Motion for his Removal or Impeachment.

EVEN a Person unacquainted with the noble Remains of antient Orators may judge,

from a few Strokes, that the Stile or Species of their Eloquence was infinitely more sublime than that which modern Orators aspire to.  How absurd would it appear, in our temperate and calm Speakers, to make Use of an _Apostrophe_, like that noble one of _Demosthenes_, so much celebrated by _Quinctilian_ and _Longinus_, when, justifying the unsuccessful Battle of _Chaeronea_, he breaks out, _No, my Fellow-Citizens, No:  You have not err'd.  I swear by the_ Manes _of those Heroes, who fought for the same Cause in the Plains of_ MARATHON _and_ PLATAEA.  Who cou'd now endure such a bold and poetical Figure, as that which _Cicero_ imploys, after describing in the most tragical Terms the Crucifixion of a _Roman_ Citizen.  _Should I paint the Horrors of this Scene, not to_ Roman _Citizens, not to the Allies of our State, not to those who have ever heard of the_ Roman /Name, not even to Men, but to Brute-Creatures; or, to go farther, should I lift up my Voice, in the most desolate Solitude, to the Rocks and Mountains, yet should I surely see those rude and inanimate Parts of Nature mov'd with Horror and Indignation at the Recital of so enormous an

Action\ <2>.  With what a Blaze of Eloquence must such a Sentence be surrounded to give it Grace, or cause it to make any Impression on the Hearers!  And what noble Art and sublime Talents are requisite to arrive, by just Degrees, at a Sentiment so bold and excessive:  To inflame the Audience, so as to make them accompany the Speaker in such violent Passions, and such elevated Conceptions:  And to conceal, under a Torrent of Eloquence, the Artifice, by which all this is effectuated!

SUITABLE to this Vehemence of Thought and Expression, was the Vehemence of Action, observed in the ancient Orators.  The _supplosio pedis_, or stamping with the Foot, was one of the most usual and moderate Gestures

they made use of <3>; tho' that is now esteem'd too violent, either for the Senate, Bar, or Pulpit, and is only admitted into the Theatre, to accompany the most violent Passions, that are there represented.

I AM somewhat at a Loss to what Cause we may ascribe so sensible a Decline of Eloquence in latter Ages.  The Genius of Mankind, at all Times, is, perhaps, equal:  The Moderns have applied themselves, with great Industry and Success, to all the other Arts and Sciences:  And one of the most learned Nations of the Universe possesses a popular Government; which seems requisite for the full Display of these noble Talents:  But notwithstanding all these Advantages, our Progress in Eloquence is very inconsiderable, in Comparison of the Advances we have made in all the other Parts of Learning.

SHALL we assert, That the Strains of antient Eloquence are unsuitable to our Age, and not to be imitated by modern Orators?  Whatever Reasons may be made Use of to prove this, I am perswaded, they will be found, upon Examination, to be unsound and unsatisfactory.

_First_, IT may be said, That, in antient Times, during the flourishing Period of the _Greek_ and _Roman_ Learning, the municipal Laws, in every State, were but few and simple, and the Decision of Causes was, in a great Measure, left to the Equity and common Sense of the Judges.  The Study of the Laws was not then a laborious Occupation, which requir'd the Drudgery of a whole Life to finish it, and was utterly incompatible with every other Study or Profession.  The great Statesmen and Generals among the _Romans_ were all Lawyers; and _Cicero_, to show the Facility of this Science, declares, That, in the midst of all his Occupations, he would undertake, in a few Days, to make himself a compleat Civilian.  Now, where a Pleader addresses himself to the Equity of his Judges, he has much more Room to display his Eloquence, than where he must draw his Arguments from strict Laws,

Statutes and Precedents.  In the former Case, many Circumstances must be taken in, many personal Considerations regarded; and even Favour and Inclination, which it belongs to the Orator, by his Art and Eloquence, to conciliate, may be disguis'd under the Appearance of Equity.  But, how shall a modern Lawyer have Leisure to quit his laborious Occupations, in order to gather the Flowers of _Parnassus_?  Or, what Opportunity shall he have of displaying them, amidst the rigid and subtile Arguments, Objections and Replies, which he is oblig'd to make Use of?  The greatest Genius, and greatest Orator, who shou'd pretend to plead before the _Chancellor_, after a Month's Study of the Laws, wou'd only labour to make himself ridiculous.

I AM ready to own, that this Circumstance, of the Multiplicity and Intricacy of Laws, is a Discouragement to Eloquence in modern Times:  But I assert, That it will not account intirely for the Decline of that noble Art.  It may banish Oratory from _Westminster-hall_, but not from either of the Houses of Parliament.  Among the _Athenians_, the _Areopagites_ expresly forbad all Allurements of Eloquence; nor

do we find, in the _Greek_ Orations wrote in the _judiciary_ Form, such a bold and rhetorical Stile as appears in the _Roman_.  But to what a Pitch did the _Athenians_ carry their Eloquence in the _deliberative_ Kind, when Affairs of State were canvast, and the Liberty, Happiness, and Honour of the Nation were the Subjects of Debate?  Disputes of this Nature elevate the Genius above all others, and give the fullest Scope to Eloquence; and such Disputes are very frequent in this Nation.

_Secondly_, IT may be pretended, That the Decline of Eloquence is owing to the superior good Sense of the Moderns, who reject, with Disdain, all those rhetorical Tricks, which may be imploy'd to seduce the Judges, and will admit of nothing but solid Argument in any Debate or Deliberation.  If a Man be accus'd of Murder, the Fact must be prov'd by Witnesses and Evidence; and the Laws will afterwards determine the Punishment of the Criminal.  It would be ridiculous to describe, in strong Colours, the Horror and Cruelty of the Action:  To introduce the Relations of the Dead; and, at a Signal, make them throw themselves at the Feet of the Judges, imploring

Justice with Tears and Lamentations:  And still more ridiculous would it be, to imploy a Painter to draw a Picture representing the bloody Feat, in order to move the Judges by the Display of so tragical a Spectacle:  Tho' we know, that this poor Artifice was sometimes practis'd by the Pleaders of Old.  Now, banish the Pathetic from public Discourses, and you reduce the Speakers merely to modern Eloquence; that is, to Good-Sense, deliver'd in proper Expressions.

PERHAPS it may be acknowledg'd, That our modern Customs, or our superior Good-Sense, if you will, should make our Orators more cautious and reserv'd than the antient, in attempting to inflame the Passions, or elevate the Imagination of their Audience:  But, I see no Reason, why it should make them despair absolutely of succeeding in that Attempt.  It should make them redouble their Art, not abandon it intirely.  The antient Orators seem also to have been on their Guard against this Jealousy of their Audience; but they took a different Way of eluding it <4>.  They hurry'd away with such a Torrent of Sublime and Pathetic,

that they left their Hearers no Leisure to perceive the Artifice, by which they were deceiv'd.  Nay, to consider the Matter aright, they were not deceiv'd by any Artifice.  The Orator, by the Force of his own Genius and Eloquence, first inflam'd himself with Anger, Indignation, Pity, Sorrow; and then communicated those impetuous Movements to his Audience.

DOES any Man pretend to have more Good-Sense than _Julius Caesar_?  Yet that haughty Conqueror, we know, was so subdu'd by the Charms of _Cicero_'s Eloquence, that he was, in a Manner, constrain'd to change his settled Purpose and Resolution, and to absolve a Criminal, whom, before that Orator appear'd, he was determin'd to condemn.

_Thirdly_, IT may be pretended, That the Disorders of the antient Governments, and the enormous Crimes, of which the Citizens were often guilty, afforded much ampler Matter for Eloquence than can be met with among the Moderns.  Were there no _Verres_ or _Cataline_, there wou'd be no _Cicero_.  But that this Reason can have no great Influence, is evident:

'Twou'd be easy to find a _Philip_ in modern Times; but where shall we find a _Demosthenes_?

WHAT remains, then, but that we lay the Blame on the Want of Genius, or of Judgment in our Speakers, who either found themselves incapable of reaching the Heights of ancient Eloquence, or rejected all such Endeavours, as unsuitable to the Spirit of modern Assemblies?  A few successful Attempts of this Nature might rouze up the Genius of the Nation, excite the Emulation of the Youth, and accustom our Ears to a more sublime and more pathetic Elocution, than what we have been hitherto entertain'd with.  There is certainly something accidental in the first Rise and the Progress of the Arts in any Nation.  I doubt if a very satisfactory Reason can be given, why antient _Rome_, while it receiv'd all its Arts from _Greece_, cou'd attain only to a Taste or Relish of Statuary, Painting and Architecture, without reaching the Practice of these noble Arts:  While modern _Rome_ has been excited, by a few Remains found among the Ruins of Antiquity, and has carried these Arts to the greatest Perfection.  Had such a cultivated Genius as my

Lord _Bolingbroke_ arisen during the Civil Wars, when Liberty began to be fully establish'd, and popular Assemblies to enter into all the most material Points of Government, I am perswaded so illustrious an Example wou'd have given a quite different Turn to _British_ Eloquence, and made us reach the Perfection of the antient Model.  Our Orators would then have done Honour to their Country, as well as our Poets and Philosophers, and _British Ciceros_ have appear'd, as well as _British Platos_ and _Virgils_.

I HAVE confest that there is something accidental in the Origin and Progress of the Arts in any Nation; and yet I cannot forbear thinking, that if the other learned and polite Nations of _Europe_ had possest the same Advantages of a popular Government, they wou'd probably have carried Eloquence to a greater Height than it has yet reach'd in _Britain_.  The _French_ Sermons, especially those of _Flechier_ and _Bourdaloue_, are much superior to the _English_ in this Particular; and in _Flechier_ there are many Strokes of the most sublime Poetry.  His Funeral Sermon on the _Marechal de Turenne_ is a good Instance.  None but private

Causes, in that Country, are ever debated before their Parliament or Courts of Judicature; but notwithstanding this Disadvantage, there appears a Spirit of Eloquence in many of their Lawyers, which, with proper Cultivation and Encouragement, might rise to the greatest Heights.  The Pleadings of _Patru_ are very elegant, and give us room to imagine what so fine a Genius cou'd have perform'd in Questions concerning public Liberty or Slavery, Peace or War, who exerts himself with such Success, in Debates concerning the Price of an old Horse, or a gossiping Story of a Quarrel betwixt an Abbess and her Nuns.  For, 'tis remarkable, that this polite Writer, though esteem'd by all the Men of Wit in his Time, was never employ'd in the most considerable Causes of their Courts of Judicature, but liv'd and dy'd in Poverty:  From an antient Prejudice industriously propagated by the Dunces in all Countries, _That a Man of Genius is unfit for Business_.  The Disorders, produc'd by the Ministry of _Cardinal Mazarine_, made the Parliament of _Paris_ enter into the Discussion of public Affairs; and during that short Interval, there appear'd many Symptoms of the Revival of antient Eloquence.  The

_Avocat-General, Talon_, in an Oration, invok'd on his Knees the Spirit of St. _Louis_ to look down with Compassion on his divided and unhappy People, and to inspire them, from above, with the Love of Concord and Unanimity <5>.  The Members of the _French_ Academy have attempted to give us Models of Eloquence in their Harangues at their Admittance:  But, having no Subject to discourse upon, they have run altogether into a fulsome Strain of Panegyric and Flattery, the most barren of all Subjects.  Their Stile, however, is commonly, on these Occasions, very elevate and sublime, and might reach the greatest Heights, were it employ'd on a Subject more favourable and engaging.

THERE are some Circumstances in the _English_ Temper and Genius, which are disadvantageous to the Progress of Eloquence, and render all Attempts of that Kind more dangerous and difficult among them than among any other Nation in the Universe.  The _English_ are conspicuous for _Good-sense_, which makes them very jealous of any Attempts to deceive them by the Flowers of Rhetoric and

Elocution.  They are also peculiarly _modest_; which makes them consider it as a Piece of Arrogance to offer any Thing but Reason to public Assemblies, or attempt to guide them by Passion or Fancy.  I may, perhaps, be allow'd to add, that the People in general are not remarkable for Delicacy of Taste, or for Sensibility to the Charms of the Muses.  Their _musical Parts_, to use the Expression of a noble Author, are but indifferent.  Hence their Comic Poets, to move them, must have Recourse to Obscenity; their Tragic Poets to Blood and Slaughter:  And hence their Orators, being depriv'd of any such Resourse, have abandon'd altogether the Hopes of moving them, and have confin'd themselves to plain Argument and Reasoning.

THESE Circumstances, join'd to particular Accidents, may, perhaps, have retarded the Growth of Eloquence in this Kingdom; but will not be able to prevent its Success, if ever it appear amongst us:  And one may safely pronounce, that this is a Field in which the most flourishing Lawrels may yet be gather'd, if any Youth of accomplish'd Genius, thoroughly acquainted with all the polite Arts,

and not ignorant of public Business, shou'd appear in Parliament, and accustom our Ears to an Eloquence more commanding and pathetic.  And to confirm me in this Opinion, there occur two Considerations, the one deriv'd from ancient, the other from modern Times.

'TIS seldom or never found, when a false Taste in Poetry or Eloquence prevails among any People, that it has been prefer'd to a true, upon Comparison and Reflection.  It commonly prevails merely from Ignorance of the true, and from the want of perfect Models, to lead Men into a juster Apprehension, and more refin'd Relish of those Productions of Genius.  When _these_ appear, they soon unite all Suffrages in their Favour, and, by their natural and powerful Charms, gain over, even the most prejudic'd, to the Love and Admiration of them.  The Principles of every Passion, and of every Sentiment, is in every Man; and when you touch them properly, they rise to Life, and warm the Heart, and convey that Satisfaction by which a Work of Genius is distinguish'd from the adulterate Beauties of a capricious Wit and Fancy.  And if this Observation be

true, with Regard to all the liberal Arts, it must be peculiarly so, with Regard to Eloquence; which, being merely calculated for the Public, and for Men of the World, cannot, with any Pretext of Reason, appeal from the People to more refin'd Judges; but must submit to the public Verdict, without Reserve or Limitation.  Whoever, upon Comparison, is deem'd by the People the greatest Orator, ought most certainly to be pronounc'd such, by Men of Science and Erudition.  And tho' an indifferent Orator may triumph for a long Time, and be esteem'd altogether perfect by the Vulgar, who are satisfy'd with his Accomplishments, and know not in what he is defective:  Yet, whenever the true Genius appears, _he_ draws to him the Attention of every one, and immediately appears superior to his Rival.

NOW, to judge, by this Rule, antient Eloquence, that is, the sublime and passionate, is of a much juster Taste than the modern, or the argumentative and rational; and, if properly executed, will always have more Command and Authority over Mankind.  We are satisfy'd with our Mediocrity, because we have had no Experience of any Thing better:  But

the Antients had Experience of both, and, upon Comparison, gave the Preference to that Kind, of which they have left us such applauded Models.  For, if I be not mistaken, our modern Eloquence is of the same Stile or Species with that which antient Critics denominated _Attic_ Eloquence, that is, calm, elegant, and subtile, which instructed the Reason more than affected the Passions, and never rais'd its Tone above Argument or common Discourse.  Such was the Eloquence of _Lysias_ among the _Athenians_, and of _Calvus_ among the _Romans_.  These were esteem'd in their Time; but when compar'd with _Demosthenes_ and _Cicero_, were ecclips'd like a Taper when set in the Rays of a meridian Sun.  Those latter Orators possess'd the same Elegance, and Subtility, and Force of Argument, with the former; but what render'd them chiefly admirable, was that Pathetic and Sublime, which, on proper Occasions, they threw into their Discourse, and by which they commanded the Resolutions of their Audience.

OF this Species of Eloquence we have scarce had any Instances in _Britain_, at least in our public Speakers.  In our Writers, we have had

some Instances, which have met with great Applause, and might assure our ambitious Youth of equal or superior Glory in Attempts for the Revival of antient Eloquence.  My Lord _Bolingbroke_'s Productions contain a Force and Energy and Sublime, which our Orators scarce ever aim at; tho' 'tis evident, that such an elevated Stile has much better Grace in a Speaker than in a Writer, and is assur'd of a more prompt and more astonishing Success.  'Tis there seconded by the Graces of Voice and Action:  The Movements are mutually communicated by Sympathy, betwixt the Orator and the Audience:  And the very Aspect of a large Assembly, attentive to the Discourse of one Man, must inspire him with a peculiar Elevation, sufficient to give a Propriety to the strongest Figures and Expressions.  'Tis true, there is a great Prejudice against _Set-Speeches_; and a Man can scarce escape Ridicule, who repeats a Discourse, as a School-boy does his Lesson, and takes no Notice of any Thing that has been advanc'd in the Course of the Debate.  But where is the Necessity of falling into this Absurdity?  A public Speaker must know before-hand the Question under Debate.  He may compose all the Arguments, Objections,

and Answers, such as he thinks will be most proper for his Discourse.  If any Thing new occur, he may supply it from his Invention; nor will the Difference be very apparent betwixt his elaborate and his extemporary Compositions.  The Mind naturally continues with the same _Impetus_ or _Force_, which it has acquir'd by its Motion; as a Vessel, once impell'd by the Oars, carries on its Course, for some Time, even when the original Impulse is suspended.

I SHALL conclude this Subject with observing, That even tho' our modern Orators shou'd not elevate their Stile, or aspire to a Rivalship with the Antients; yet there is a material Defect in most of their Speeches, which they might correct, without departing from that compos'd Air of Argument and Reasoning, to which they limit their Ambition.  Their great Affectation of extemporary Discourses has made them reject all Order and Method, which seems so requisite to Argument, and without which 'tis scarce possible to produce an intire Conviction in the Mind.  'Tis not, that I wou'd recommend many formal Divisions in a public Discourse, unless the Subject very evidently

offer them:  But 'tis easy, without this Formality, to observe a Method, and make that Method conspicuous to the Hearer, who will be infinitely pleas'd to see the Arguments rise naturally from one another, and will retain a more thorough Perswasion, than can arise from the strongest Reasons, which are thrown together in Confusion.

ESSAY V.

_Of the_ RISE _and_ PROGRESS /of

the\ ARTS _and_ SCIENCES.

THERE is not a Matter of greater Nicety, in our Enquiries concerning human Affairs, than to distinguish exactly what is owing to _Chance_, and what proceeds from _Causes_; nor is there any Thing, in which an Author is more apt to deceive himself, by false Subtilties and Refinements.  To say, that any Event is deriv'd from Chance, cuts short all farther Enquiry concerning it, and leaves the Writer in the same State of Ignorance with all the rest of Mankind.  But when the Event is supposed to proceed from certain and stable Causes, he may then display his Ingenuity, in assigning these Causes; and as a Man of any Subtility can never be at a Loss in this Particular, he has thereby an Opportunity of swelling his Volumes, and discovering his profound Knowledge, in observing what escapes the Vulgar and Ignorant.

THE  distinguishing betwixt Chance and Causes must depend upon every particular Man's Sagacity, in considering every particular Incident.  But, if I were to assign any general Rule to help us in applying this Distinction, it wou'd be the following, _What depends upon a few Persons is, in a great Measure, to be ascrib'd to Chance, or secret and unknown Causes:  What arises from a great Number, may often be accounted for by determinate and known Causes_.

THERE may two very natural Reasons be assign'd for this Rule.  _First_, If you suppose a Dye to have any Byass, however small, to a particular Side, this Byass, tho', perhaps, it may not appear in a few Throws, will certainly prevail in a great Number, and will cast the Balance intirely to that Side.  In like Manner, when any _Causes_ beget a particular Inclination or Passion, at a certain Time, and among a certain People; tho' many Individuals may escape the Contagion, and be rul'd by Passions peculiar to themselves; yet the Multitude will certainly be infected with the common Passion, and be govern'd by it in all their Actions.

_Secondly_, THOSE Principles or Causes, which are fitted to operate on a Multitude, are always of a grosser and more stubborn Nature, less subject to Accidents, and less influenc'd by Whim and private Fancy, than those which operate on a few only.  The latter are commonly so delicate and refin'd, that the smallest Incident in the Health, Education, or Fortune of particular Persons, is sufficient to divert their Course, and retard their Operation; nor is it possible to reduce them to any general Maxims or Observations.  Their Influence at one Time, will never assure us concerning their Influence at another; even tho' all the general Circumstances shou'd be the same in both Cases.

TO judge by this Rule, the domestic and the gradual Revolutions of a State, must be a more proper Subject of Reasoning and Observation, than the foreign and the momentary, which are commonly produc'd by single Persons, and are more influenc'd by Whim, Folly, or Caprice, than by general Passions and Interests.  The Depression of the Lords, and Rise of the Commons in _England_, after the Statute of Alienations, and the Increase of

Trade and Industry, are more easily accounted for by general Principles, than the Depression of the _Spanish_, and Rise of the _French_ Monarchy, after the Death of _Charles Quint_.  Had _Harry_ IV. Cardinal _Richelieu_, and _Louis_ XIV. been _Spaniards_; and _Philip_ II. III. and IV. and _Charles_ II. been _Frenchmen_, the History of these two Nations had been intirely revers'd.

FOR the same Reason, 'tis more easy to account for the Rise and Progress of Commerce in any Kingdom, than for that of Learning; and a State, that shou'd apply itself to the Encouragement of the one, wou'd be much more assur'd of Success, than one which shou'd cultivate the other.  Avarice, or the Desire of Gain, is an universal Passion, that operates at all Times, in all Places, and upon all Persons:  But Curiosity, or the Love of Knowledge, has but a very limited Influence, and requires Youth, Leisure, Education, Genius, and Example, to make it govern any Person.  You will never want Booksellers, while there are Buyers of Books:  But there may frequently be Readers, where there are no Authors.  Multitudes of People, Necessity and Liberty, have



57

begot Commerce in _Holland_:  But Study and Application have not produc'd any eminent Writers.

WE may, therefore, conclude, that there is no Subject, wherein we must proceed with more Caution, than in tracing the History of the Arts and Sciences; lest we assign Causes that never existed, and reduce what is merely contingent to stable and universal Principles.  Those, who cultivate the Sciences in any State, are always few in Number:  The Passion, that governs them, limited:  Their Taste and Judgment tender and easily perverted:  And their Application disturb'd with the smallest Accident.  Chance, therefore, or secret and unknown Causes, must have a great Influence on the Rise and Progress of all the refin'd Arts.

BUT there is a Reason, which induces me not to ascribe the Matter altogether to Chance.  Tho' the Persons, that cultivate the Sciences with such astonishing Success, as to attract the Admiration of Posterity, be always few, in all Nations, and all Ages; 'tis impossible but a Share of the same Spirit and Genius must be antecedently diffus'd thro' the People among

whom they arise, in order to produce, form, and cultivate, from their earliest Infancy, the Taste and Judgment of those eminent Writers.  The Mass cannot be altogether insipid, from which such refin'd Spirits are extracted <1>.  _There is a GOD within us_, says _Ovid, who breathes that Divine Fire, by which we are  animated_.  Poets, in all Ages, have advanc'd this Claim to Inspiration.  There is not, however, any Thing supernatural in the Case.  Their Fire is not kindled from Heaven.  It only runs along the Earth; is caught from one Breast to another; and burns brightest, where the Materials are best prepar'd, and most happily dispos'd.  The Question, therefore, concerning the Rise and Progress of the Arts and Sciences, is not altogether a Question concerning the Taste, Genius, and Spirit of a few, but concerning those of a whole People; and may, therefore, be accounted for, in some Measure, by general Causes and Principles.  I grant, that a Man, who shou'd enquire, why such a particular Poet, as _Homer_ for Instance, existed in such a Place, at such a Time, wou'd throw himself Head-long into Chimaera, and cou'd never treat of such a Subject, without a Multitude of false Subtilties and Refinements.  He might as well pretend to give a Reason, why such particular Generals, as _Fabius_ and _Scipio_, liv'd in _Rome_ at such a Time, and why _Fabius_ came into the World before _Scipio_. For such Incidents as those, no other Reason can be given but that of _Horace_.

/Scit genius, natale comes, qui temperat astrum

Naturae Deus humanae, mortalis in unum --

-- Quodque caput, vultu mutabilis, albus & ater\.

BUT, I am perswaded, that in many Cases very good Reasons might be given, why such a particular Nation is more polite and learned, at a particular Time, than any of its Neighbours.  At least, this is so curious a Subject, that 'tis a Pity to abandon it intirely, before we have found, whether or not it be susceptible of Reasoning, and can be reduc'd to any general Principles.  I shall, therefore, proceed to deliver a few Observations on this Subject, which I submit, with entire Deference, to the Censure and Examination of the Learned.

MY first Observation is, _That it is impossible for the Arts and Sciences to arise, at first, among any People, unless that People enjoy the Blessing of a free Government_.

IN the first Ages of the World, when Men are, as yet, barbarous and ignorant, they seek for no farther Security against mutual Violence and Injustice, than the Choice of some Rulers, few or many, in whom they place an implicite Confidence, without providing any Security, by Laws or political Institutions, against the Violence and Injustice of these Rulers.  If the Authority be center'd in a single Person, and if the People, by Conquest or Generation, increase to a great Multitude, the Monarch, finding it impossible, in his own Person, to execute every Office of Sovereignty, in every Place, must delegate his Authority to inferior Magistrates, who preserve Peace and Order in their particular Districts.  As Experience and Education have not yet refin'd the Wits of Men to any considerable Degree, the Prince, who is himself unrestrain'd, never dreams of restraining his Ministers, but delegates his full Authority to every one, whom he sets over any Portion of the People.  All general Laws

are attended with Inconveniencies, when apply'd to particular Cases; and it requires great Penetration and Experience, both to perceive that these Inconveniencies are fewer than what result from full discretionary Powers in every Magistrate; and also, to discern what general Laws are, upon the Whole, attended with fewest Inconveniencies.  This is a Matter of so great Difficulty, that Men may have made some Advances, even in the sublime Arts of Poetry and Eloquence, where a Rapidity of Genius and Imagination assists their Progress, before they have arriv'd at any great Refinements in their Municipal Laws, where frequent Trials, and diligent Observation can alone direct their Improvements.  It is not, therefore, to be suppos'd, that  a barbarous Monarch, unrestrain'd and uninstructed, will ever become a Legislator, or think of restraining his _Bashas_ in every Province, or even his _Cadis_ in every Village.  We are told, that the late _Czar_, tho' actuated with a noble Genius, and smit with the Love and Admiration of _European_ Arts; yet profest an Esteem for the _Turkish_ Policy in this Particular, and approv'd of the summary Decisions of Causes, which are practis'd in that barbarous Monarchy, where the Judges are not restrain'd by any Methods, Forms, or Laws.  He did not perceive, how contrary such a Practice wou'd have been to all his other Endeavours for refining his People.  Despotic Power, in all Cases, is somewhat oppressive and debasing; but 'tis altogether ruinous and intolerable, when contracted into a small Compass; and becomes still worse, when the Person, who possesses it, knows that the Time of his Authority is limited and uncertain.  _Habet subjectos tanquam suos; viles, ut alienos_ <2>.  He governs the Subjects with full Authority, as if they were his own; and with Negligence or Tyranny, as belonging to another.  A People govern'd after such a Manner are _Slaves_, in the full and proper Sense of the Word; and 'tis impossible they can ever aspire to any Refinements of Taste or Reason.  They dare not so much as pretend to enjoy the Necessaries of Life, in Plenty or Security.

TO expect, therefore, that the Arts and Sciences should ever take their _first_ Rise in a Monarchy, is to expect a Contradiction.  Before these Refinements have been study'd, the Monarch

is ignorant and barbarous; and, not having Knowledge sufficient to make him sensible of the Necessity of balancing his Government upon general Laws, he delegates his full Powers to all inferior Magistrates.  This barbarous Policy debases the People, and for ever prevents all Improvement.  Were it possible, that, before Science was known in the World, a Monarch could possess so much Wisdom as to become a Legislator, and govern his People by Law, not by the arbitrary Will of their Fellow-subjects, it might be possible for that Species of Government to be the first Nursery of Arts and Sciences.  But in that Supposition there seems to be a manifest Repugnancy.

'TIS possible, that a Republic, in its Infant-state, may be supported by as few Laws as a barbarous Monarchy, and may entrust as unlimited an Authority to its Magistrates or Judges.  But, besides that the frequent Elections of these Magistrates by the People, are a considerable Check upon their Authority; 'tis unavoidable, but, in a Tract of Time, the Necessity of restraining the Magistrates, in order to preserve Liberty, must at last appear, and give Rise to general Laws and Statutes.  The _Roman_ Consuls, for some Time, decided all Causes, without being confin'd by any positive Laws, till the People, bearing this Yoke with Impatience, created the _Decemvirs_, who promulgated the _twelve Tables_; a Body of Laws, which, tho', perhaps, they were not equal in Bulk to one _English_ Act of Parliament, were the only written Rules that regulated Property and Punishment, for some Ages, in that famous Republic.  They were, however, sufficient, along with the Forms of a free Government, to secure the Lives and Properties of the Citizens; to exempt one Man from the Dominion of another; and to protect every one from the Violence or Tyranny of his Fellow-citizens.  In such a Situation, the Sciences may raise their Heads, and flourish:  But never can have Being amidst such a Scene of Oppression and Slavery, as always results from barbarous Monarchies, where the People alone are restrain'd by the Authority of the Magistrates, and the Magistrates are not restrain'd by any Law or Statute.  An unlimited Despotism of this Nature, while it exists, effectually stops all Improvement, and keeps Men from attaining that Knowledge, which is requisite to instruct them in the Advantages arising from  a better Police, and more moderate Authority.

HERE then are the Advantages of Republics.  Tho' a Republic shou'd be barbarous, it necessarily, by an infallible Operation, gives Rise to LAW, even before Mankind have made any considerable Advances in the other Sciences.  From Law arises Security:  From Security Curiosity:  And from Curiosity Knowledge.  The latter Steps of this Progress may be more accidental; but the former are altogether necessary.  A Republic, without Laws, can never have any Duration.  On the contrary, in a Monarchical Government, Law arises not necessarily from the Forms of the Government.  Monarchy, when absolute, contains even something repugnant to Law.  Great Wisdom and Reflection can alone reconcile them.  But such a Degree of Wisdom can never be expected, before the greater Refinements and Improvements of human Reason.  These Refinements require Curiosity, Security and Law.  The _first_ Growth, therefore, of the Arts and Sciences can never be expected in despotic Governments.

ACCORDING to the necessary Progress of Things, Law must precede Science.  In Republics Law may precede Science, and may arise from the very Nature of the Government.  In Monarchies it arises not from the Nature of the Government, and cannot precede Science.  An absolute Prince, that is barbarous, renders all his Ministers and Magistrates as absolute as himself:  And there needs no more to prevent, for ever, all Industry, Curiosity and Science.

THERE are other Causes, which discourage the Rise of the refin'd Arts in despotic Governments; tho' I take the Want of Laws, and the Delegation of full Powers to every petty Magistrate, to be the principal.  Eloquence certainly arises more naturally in popular Governments:  Emulation too, in every Accomplishment, must be there more animated and enliven'd:  And Genius and Capacity have a fuller Scope and Career.  All these Causes render free Governments the only proper _Nursery_ for the Arts and Sciences.

THE second Observation I shall form on this Head, is, _That nothing is more favourable to  the Rise of Politeness and Learning, than a Number of neighbouring independent States connected together by Commerce and Policy_.  The Emulation, which naturally rises among those neighbouring States, is an obvious Source of Improvement:  But what I wou'd chiefly insist on is the Stop, that such limited Territories give both to _Power_ and to _Authority_.

EXTENDED Governments, where a single Person has great Influence, become immediately despotic; but small ones change naturally into Commonwealths.  A large Government is accustom'd by Degrees to Tyranny; because each Act of Violence is at first perform'd upon a Part, which, being distant from the Majority, is not taken Notice of, nor excites any violent Ferment.  Besides, a large Government, tho' the whole be discontented, may, by a little Art, be kept in Obedience; because each Part, being ignorant of the Resolutions of the rest, is afraid to begin any Commotion or Insurrection.  Not to mention, that there is a superstitious Reverence for Princes, which Mankind naturally fall into when they do not often see the Prince, and when many of them become not acquainted with him, so as to find him but a Man.  And as large States can afford a great Expence, in order to support the Pomp of Majesty, this is a Kind of Fascination on Mankind, and naturally contributes to the enslaving of them.

IN a small Government, any Act of Oppression is immediately known thro' the whole:  The Murmurs and Discontents, proceeding from it, are easily communicated:  And the Indignation rises the higher, that the Subjects are not apt to apprehend, in such States, that the Distance is very wide betwixt themselves and their Sovereign.  "The greatest Enemies to the Glory of Heroes, says a certain Writer, are their _Valet de Chambres_."  'Tis certain, that Admiration and Acquaintance are altogether incompatible with Regard to any mortal Creature.  _Antigonus_, being complimented by his Flatterers, as a Deity, and as the Son of that glorious Planet, which illuminates the Universe.  _Upon that Head_, says he, _you may consult the Person that empties my close Stool_.  Sleep and Love convinc'd _Alexander_, that he was not a God:  But I suppose those who attended him daily, cou'd have given many other still more convincing  Proofs of his Humanity, in the numberless Weaknesses to which he was subject.

BUT the Divisions into small States are favourable to Learning, by stopping the Progress of _Authority_, as well as that of _Power_.  Reputation is often as great a Fascination upon Mankind as Sovereignty, and is equally destructive to the Freedom of Thought and Examination.  But where a Number of neighbouring States have a great Intercourse of Arts and Commerce, their mutual Jealousy keeps them from receiving too lightly the law from each other, in Matters of Taste or of Reasoning, and makes them examine every Work of Art with the greatest Care and Accuracy.  The Contagion of popular Opinion spreads not so easily from one Place to another.  It readily receives a Check in some State or other, where it concurs not with the prevailing Prejudices.  And nothing but Nature or Reason can force its Way thro' all Obstacles, and unite the most rival Nations into an Esteem and Admiration of it.

_GREECE_ was a Cluster of little Principalities, which soon became Republics; and being united both by their near Neighbourhood, and by the Ties of the same Language and Interest, they enter'd into the closest Intercourse of Commerce and of Learning.  There concurr'd a happy Climate, a fertile Soil, and a most harmonious and comprehensive Language; so that every Circumstance, among that People, seem'd to favour the Rise of the Arts and Sciences.  Each City produc'd its several Artists and Philosophers, who refus'd to yield the Preference to those of the neighbouring Republics:  Their Debates and Contentions sharpen'd the Wits of Men:  A Variety of Objects was presented to the Judgment, while each challeng'd the Preference to the rest:  And the Sciences, not being dwarf'd by the Restraint of Authority, were enabled to make such considerable Shoots, as are, even at this Time, the Objects of our Admiration.  After the _Roman Christian_ or _Catholic_ Church had spread itself over the civiliz'd World, and had engrost all the Learning of the Times, being really one large State within itself, and united under one Head; this Variety of Sects immediately disappear'd, and the _Peripatetic_ Philosophy was alone admitted into all the Schools, to the utter Depravation of every Kind of Learning.  But Mankind having, at Length, thrown off this Yoke, Affairs are now return'd nearly to the same Situation as before, and _Europe_ is at present a Copy at large, of what _Greece_ was formerly a Pattern in Miniature.  We have seen the Advantage of this Situation in several Instances.  What check'd the Progress of the _Cartesian_ Philosophy, to which the _French_ Nation shew'd such a strong Propensity towards the End of the last Century, but the Opposition made to it by the other Nations of _Europe_, who soon discover'd the weak Sides of that Philosophy?  The severest Scrutiny, that _Newton's_ Theory has undergone, proceeded not from his Countrymen but Foreigners; and if it can overcome the Obstacles it meets with at present in all Parts of _Europe_, it will probably go down triumphant to the latest Posterity.  The _English_ are become sensible of the scandalous Licentiousness of their Stage, from the Example of the _French_ Decency and Morals.  The _French_ are convinc'd, that their Theatre has become somewhat effeminate, by too much Love and Gallantry, and begin to approve of the more masculine Taste of some of their neighbouring Nations. IN _China_ there seems to be a pretty considerable Stock of Politeness and Science, which, in the Course of so many Centuries, might naturally be expected to ripen into something more perfect and finish'd, than what has yet arisen from them.  But _China_ is one vast Empire, speaking one Language, govern'd by one Law, and sympathizing in the same Manners.  The Authority of any Teacher, such as _Confucius_, was propagated easily from one Corner of the Empire to another.  None had the Courage to resist the Torrent of popular Opinions.  And Posterity were not bold enough to dispute what had been universally receiv'd by their Ancestors.  This seems to be one natural Reason, why the Sciences have made so slow a Progress in that mighty Empire.

IF we consider the Face of the Globe, _Europe_, of all the four Parts of the World, is the most broken by Seas, Rivers and Mountains; and _Greece_ of all Countries of _Europe_.  Hence these Regions were naturally divided into several distinct Governments.  And hence the Sciences arose in _Greece_; and _Europe_ has  been hitherto the most constant Habitation of them.

I HAVE sometimes been inclin'd to think, that Interruptions in the Periods of Learning, were they not attended with such a Destruction of antient Books, and the Records of History, wou'd be rather favourable to the Arts and Sciences, by breaking the Progress of Authority, and dethroning the tyrannical Usurpers over human Reason.  In this Particular, they have the same Influence, as Interruptions in political Governments and Societies.  Consider the slavish Submission of the antient Philosophers to the several Masters in each School, and you'll be convinc'd, that no good cou'd ever be expected from a hundred Centuries of such a servile Philosophy.  Even the _Eclectics_, who arose about the Age of _Augustus_, notwithstanding their professing to chuse freely what pleas'd them from every different Sect, were yet, in the Main, as slavish and dependent as any of their Brethren; since they sought for Truth, not in Nature, but in the several Schools; where they suppos'd she must necessarily be found, tho' not united in a Body, yet dispers'd in Parts.  Upon the Revival

of Learning, those Sects of _Stoics_, and _Epicureans, Platonists_ and _Pythagoreans_ cou'd never regain any Credit or Authority; and, at the same Time, by the Example of their Fall, kept Men from submitting, with such blind Deference, to those new Sects, which have attempted to gain an Ascendant over them.

THE _third_ Observation I shall form on this Head, of the Rise and Progress of the Arts and Sciences, is, _That tho' the only proper_ Nursery _of these noble Plants be a free Government, yet they may be transplanted into any Government; and that a Republic is most favourable to the Growth of the Sciences, and a civiliz'd Monarchy to that of the polite Arts_.

TO balance a large State or Society, whether Monarchical or Republican, on general Laws, is a Work of so great Difficulty, that no human Genius, however comprehensive, is able, by the mere Dint of Reason and Reflection, to effectuate it.  The Judgments of many must unite in this Work:  Experience must guide their Labour:  Time must bring it to Perfection:  And the feeling of Inconveniencies must correct the Mistakes, which they

inevitably fall into, in their frequent Trials and Experiments.  Hence the Impossibility appears, that this Undertaking should be begun and carried on in any Monarchy; since such a Form of Government, before it be civiliz'd, knows no other Secret in Policy, than that of entrusting unlimited Powers with every Governor or Magistrate, and subdividing the People into so many Classes and Orders of Slavery.  From such a Situation, no Improvements can ever be expected in the Sciences, in the liberal Arts, in Laws, and scarce in the manual Arts or Manufactures.  The same Barbarity and Ignorance, with which the Government commences, is propagated to all Posterity, and can never come to a Period by the Efforts or Ingenuity of such unhappy Slaves.

BUT tho' LAW, the Source of all Security and Happiness, arises late in any Government, and is the slow Product of Order and of Liberty, it is not preserv'd with the same Difficulty, that it is produc'd; but when it has once taken Root, is a hardy Plant, which will scarce ever perish thro' the ill Culture of Men, or the Rigour of the Seasons.  The Arts of Luxury, and much more the liberal Arts,

which depend on a refin'd Taste or Sentiment, are easily lost; because they are always relish'd by a few only, whose Leisure, Fortune and Genius fit them for such Amusements.  But what is profitable to every Mortal, and in common Life, when once it is discover'd, can scarce ever perish, but by the total Subversion of Society, and by such furious Inundations of barbarous Invaders, as obliterate all Memory of former Arts and Civility.  Imitation also is apt to transport these coarser and more useful Arts from one Climate to another, and make them precede the refin'd Arts in their Progress; tho perhaps they sprung after them in their first Rise and Propagation.  From these Causes proceed civiliz'd Monarchies, where the Arts of Government, first invented in free States, are preserv'd, to the mutual Advantage and Security of Sovereign and Subject.

HOWEVER perfect, therefore, the Monarchical Form may appear to some Politicians, it owes all its Perfection to the Republican; nor is it possible, that a pure Despotism, establish'd among a barbarous People, can ever, by its native Force and Energy, refine and polish itself.  It must borrow its Laws, and Methods, and Institutions, and consequently its Stability and Order, from free Governments.  These Advantages are the sole Growth of Republics.  The extensive Despotism of a barbarous Monarchy, by entering into the Detail of the Government, as well as into the principal Points of Administration, for ever prevents all such Improvements.

IN a civiliz'd Monarchy, the Prince alone is unrestrain'd in the Exercise of his Authority, and possesses alone a Power, which is not bounded by any Thing but Custom, Example, and the Sense of his own Interest.  Every Minister or Magistrate, however eminent, must submit to the general Laws, which govern the whole Society, and must exert the Authority delegated to him after the Manner, which is prescrib'd.  The People depend on none but their Sovereign, for the Security of their Property.  He is so far remov'd from them, and is so much exempt from private Jealousies or Interests, that this Dependence is not felt.  And thus a Species of Government arises, to which, in a high political Rant, we may give the Name of _Tyranny_, but which, by a just and prudent Administration,  may afford sufficient Security to the People, and may fulfil almost every End of political Society.

BUT tho' in a civiliz'd Monarchy, as well as in a Republic, the People have sufficient Security for the Enjoyment of their Property; yet in both these Forms of Government, those who possess the supreme Authority have the Disposal of many Honours and Advantages, which sufficiently excite the Ambition and Avarice of Mankind.  The only Difference is, that in a Republic, the Candidates for Offices must look downwards, to gain the Suffrages of the People; in a Monarchy, must turn their Attention upwards, to court the good Graces and Favour of the Great.  To be successful in the former Way, 'tis necessary for a Man to make himself _useful_, by his Industry, Capacity, or Knowledge:  To be prosperous in the latter Way, 'tis requisite for him to render himself _agreeable_, by his Wit, Complaisance, or Civility.  A strong Genius succeeds best in Republics:  A refin'd Taste in Monarchies.  And consequently the Sciences are the more natural Growth of the one, and the polite Arts of the other. NOT to mention, that Monarchies, receiving their chief Stability from a superstitious Reverence to Priests and Princes, have always abridg'd the Liberty of Reasoning, with Regard to Religion and Politics, and consequently Metaphysics and Morals.  All these form the most considerable Branches of Science.  Mathematics and natural Philosophy, which are the only ones that remain, are not half so valuable.

THERE is a very great Connection among all the Arts, that contribute to Pleasure; and the same Delicacy of Taste, which enables us to make Improvements in one, will not allow the others to remain altogether rude and barbarous.  Amongst all the Arts of Conversation, no one pleases more than mutual Deference and Civility, which leads us to resign our own Inclinations to those of our Companion, and to curb and conceal that Presumption and Arrogance so natural to the Mind of Man.  A good-natur'd Man, that is well educated, practices this Civility to every Mortal, without Premeditation or Interest:  But, in order to render that valuable Quality general among any People, it seems necessary to assist the natural Dispositions by some general Motive. Where Power rises upwards from the People to the Great, as in all Republics, such Refinements of Civility are apt to be little practis'd; since the whole State are, by that Means, brought near to a Level, and every Member of it is render'd, in a great Measure, independent of another.  The People have the Advantage, by the Authority of their Suffrages:  The Great, by the Superiority of their Station.  But in a civiliz'd Monarchy, there is a long Train of Dependence from the Prince to the Peasant, which is not great enough to render Property precarious, or depress the Minds of the People; but is sufficient to beget in every one an Inclination to please his Superiors, and form himself upon those Models, which are most acceptable to People of Condition and Education.  Politeness of Manners, therefore, arises most naturally in Monarchies and Courts; and where that flourishes, none of the liberal Arts will be altogether neglected or despis'd.

THE Republics in _Europe_ are at present noted for Want of Politeness.  _The good Manners of a_ Swiss _civiliz'd in_ Holland <3>, is another Expression for Rusticity among the _French_.  The _English_ fall under the same Censure, notwithstanding their Learning and Genius.  And if the _Venetians_ be an Exception to the Rule, they owe it, perhaps, to their Communication with the other _Italians_, most of whose Governments beget a Dependence more than sufficient for the civilizing their Manners.

'TIS difficult to pronounce any Judgment concerning the Refinements of the antient Republics in this Particular:  But I am apt to suspect, that the Arts of Conversation were not brought so near Perfection amongst them as the Arts of Writing and Composition.  Their Scurrility, in many Instances, is quite shocking, and exceeds all Belief.  Their Vanity also is not a little offensive; as well as the common Licentiousness and Immodesty of their Stile.  _Quicunque impudicus, adulter, ganeo, manu, ventre_, pene, _bona patria laceraverat_, says _Salust_ in one of the gravest and most moral Passages of his History.  _Nam fuit ante Helenam Cunnus teterrima belli causa_, is an Expression of _Horace_, in tracing the Origin of moral Good and Evil.  _Ovid_ and _Lucretius_ <4> are almost as licentious in their Stile as my Lord _Rochester_; tho' the former were fine Gentlemen and delicate Writers, and the latter was an abandon'd and shameless Profligate.  _Juvenal_ inculcates Modesty with great Zeal; but sets a very bad Example of it, if we consider the Impudence of his Expressions.

I SHALL also be so bold, as to affirm, That among the Antients, there was not much Delicacy of breeding, or that polite Deference and Respect, which Civility obliges us either to express or counterfeit towards the Persons we converse with.  _Cicero_ was certainly one of the politest Gentlemen of his Age; and yet I must confess I have frequently been shockt with the poor Figure under which he represents his Friend _Atticus_, in those Dialogues, wherein he himself is introduc'd as a Speaker.  That learned and virtuous _Roman_, whose Dignity, tho' he was only a private Gentleman,  was inferior to that of no one in _Rome_, is there shewn in rather a more pitiful Light than _Philalethes_'s Friend in our modern Dialogues.  He is a humble Admirer of the Orator, pays him frequent Compliments, and receives his Instructions, with all the Deference that a Scholar owes to his Master.  Even _Cato_ is treated in a very Cavalier-manner in the Dialogues _de finibus_.  And 'tis remarkable, that _Cicero_, being a great Sceptic in Matters of Religion, and unwilling to determine any Thing on that Head among the different Sects of Philosophy, introduces his Friends disputing concerning the Being and Nature of the Gods, while he is only a Hearer; because, forsooth, it would have been an Impropriety for so great a Genius as himself, had he spoke, not to have said something decisive on the Subject, and have carried every Thing before him, as he always does on other Occasions.  There is also a Spirit of Dialogue observ'd in the charming Books _de Oratore_, and a tolerable Equality maintain'd among the Speakers:  But then these Speakers are the great Men of the Age preceeding our Author, and he recounts the Conference as only from Hearsay. 'TIS but a very indifferent Compliment, which _Horace_ pays to his Friend _Grosphus_, in the Ode addrest to him <5>.  _No one_, says he, _is happy in every Respect.  And I may perhaps enjoy some Advantages, which you are depriv'd of.  You possess great Riches:  Your bellowing Herds cover the_ Silician _Plains: Your Chariot is drawn by the finest Horses:  And you are array'd in the richest Purple.  But the indulgent Fates, with a small Inheritance, have given_ ME _a fine Genius, and have endow'd me with a Contempt for the malignant Judgments of the Vulgar.  Phaedrus_ says to his Patron, _Eutychus, If you design to read my Works, I shall be pleas'd:  If not, I shall, at least, have  the Advantage of pleasing Posterity_ <6>.  I am apt to think, that a modern Poet wou'd not have been guilty of such an Impropriety as that which may be observ'd in _Virgil's_ Address to _Augustus_, when, after a great deal of extravagant Flattery, and after having deify'd the Emperor, according to the Custom of those Times, he, at last, places this God on the same Level with himself <7>.  _By your gracious Nod_, says he, _render my undertaking prosperous; and taking Pity_, along with me, _of the Swains ignorant of Husbandry, bestow your favourable Influence on this Work_.  Had Men, in that Age, been accustom'd to observe such Niceties, a Writer so delicate as _Virgil_ wou'd certainly have given a different Turn to this Sentence.  The Court of _Augustus_, however polite, had not yet, it seems, wore off the Manners of the Republic.

CARDINAL _Wolsey_ apologiz'd for his famous Piece of Insolence, in saying, EGO ET REX MEUS, _I and my King_, by observing, that this Expression was exactly conformable to the _Latin_ Idiom, and that a _Roman_ always nam'd himself before the Person to whom, or of whom he spake.  Yet this seems to have been an Instance of Want of Civility among that People.  The Antients made it a Rule, That the Person of the greatest Dignity shou'd be mention'd  first in the Discourse; insomuch, that we find, the Spring of a Quarrel and Jealousy betwixt the _Romans_ and _Aetolians_, to have been a Poet's naming the _Aetolians_ before the _Romans_, in celebrating a Victory gain'd by their united Arms over the _Macedonians_ <8>.

IF the Superiority in Politeness shou'd be allow'd to modern Times, the modern Notions of _Gallantry_ and _Honour_, the natural Product of Courts and Monarchies, will probably be assign'd as the Causes of this Refinement.  No one denies these Inventions to be modern <9>:  But some of the most zealous Partizans of the Antients, have asserted them to be foppish and ridiculous, and a Reproach, rather than an Honour to the present Age <10>.  It may here be proper to examine this Question, with regard both to Gallantry and Honour.  We shall begin with Gallantry.

NATURE has implanted in all living Creatures an Affection betwixt the Sexes, which even in the fiercest and most rapacious Animals, is not merely confin'd to the Satisfaction of the bodily Appetite, but begets a Friendship and mutual Sympathy, that runs thro' the whole Tenor of their Lives.  Nay, it may farther be observ'd, that even in those Species, where Nature confines the Indulgence of this Appetite to one Season and to one Object, and forms a Kind of Marriage or Association betwixt a single Male and Female, there is yet a visible Complacency and Benevolence, which extends farther, and mutually softens the Affections of the Sexes towards each other <11>.  How much more must this have Place in Man, where the Confinement of the Appetite is not natural; but either proceeds accidentally from some strong Charm of Love, or arises from Reflections on Duty and Convenience?  Nothing, therefore, can proceed less from Affectation than the Passion of Gallantry.  'Tis _natural_ in the highest Degree.  Art and Education, in the most polish'd and refin'd Courts, make no more Alteration on it, than on all the other laudable Passions.  They only turn the Mind more towards it:  They refine it; they polish it; and give it a proper Grace and Expression.

BUT Gallantry is as _generous_ as it is _natural_.  To correct such gross Vices, as commit a real Injury to others, is the Part of Morals, and the Object of the most ordinary Education.  Where _that_ is not attended to, in some Degree, no human Society can subsist.  But in order to render Conversation, and the Intercourse of Minds more easy and agreeable, Good-manners have been invented, and have carry'd the Matter somewhat farther.  Wherever Nature has given the Mind a Propensity to any Vice, or to any Passion disagreeable to others, refin'd Breeding has taught Men to throw the Byass on the opposite Side, and to preserve, in all their Behaviour, the Appearance of Sentiments contrary to those which they naturally incline to.  Thus, as we are naturally proud and selfish, and apt to assume the Preference above others, a polite Man is taught to behave with Deference towards those he converses with, and to yield the Superiority to them in all the common Incidents of Society.  In like Manner, wherever a Person's Situation may naturally beget any disagreeable Suspicion in him, 'tis the Part of Good-manners to prevent it, by a studied Display of Sentiments, directly contrary to those which he is apt to be jealous of.  Thus, old Men know their Infirmities, and are apt to dread Contempt from the Youth:  Hence, well-educated Youth redouble the Instances of Respect and Deference to their Elders.  Strangers and Foreigners are without Protection:  Hence, in all polite Countries, they receive the highest Civilities, and are intitled to the first Place in every Company.  A Man is Lord in his own Family, and his Guests are, in a Manner, subjected to his Authority:  Hence, he is always the lowest Person in the Company; attentive to the Wants of every one; and giving himself all the Trouble, in order to please, which may not betray too visible an Affectation, or impose too much Constraint on his Guests.  Gallantry is nothing but an Instance of the same generous and refin'd Behaviour.  As Nature has  given _Man_ the Superiority above _Woman_, by endowing him with greater Strength both of Mind and Body, 'tis his Part to alleviate that Superiority, as much as possible, by the Generosity of his Behaviour, and by a study'd Deference and Complaisance for all her Inclinations and Opinions.  Barbarous Nations display this Superiority, by reducing their Females to the most abject Slavery; by confining them, by beating them, by selling them, by killing them.  But the Male-Sex, among a polite People, discover their Authority in a more generous, tho not a less evident Manner; by Civility, by Respect, by Complaisance, and, in a Word, by Gallantry.  In good Company, you need not ask, Who is the Master of the Feast?  The Person, who sits in the lowest Place, and who is always industrious in helping every one, is most certainly the Person.  We must either condemn all such Instances of Generosity, as foppish and affected, or admit of Gallantry among the rest.  The antient _Muscovites_ wedded their Wives with a Whip, instead of a Wedding-Ring.  The same People, in their own Houses, took always the Precedency above Foreigners, even foreign <12> Ambassadors. These two Instances of their Generosity and Politeness are much of a Piece.

GALLANTRY is not less consistent with _Wisdom_ and _Prudence_, than with _Nature_ and _Generosity_; and, when under proper Regulations, contributes, more than any other Invention, to the _Entertainment_ and _Improvement_ of the Youth of both Sexes.  In all Vegetables, 'tis observable, that the Flower and the Seed are always connected together; and in like Manner, among every Species of Animals, Nature has founded on the Love betwixt the Sexes their sweetest and best Enjoyment.  But the Satisfaction of the bodily Appetite is not alone of great Value; and even in brute Creatures, we find, that their Play and Dalliance, and other Expressions of Fondness, form the greatest Part of the Entertainment.  In rational Creatures, we must certainly admit the Mind for a considerable Share.  Were we to rob the Feast of all its Garniture of Reason, Discourse, Sympathy, Friendship, and Gaiety, what remains wou'd scarce be worth Acceptance, in the Judgment of the truly elegant and luxurious. WHAT better School for Manners, than the Company of virtuous Women; where the mutual Endeavour to please must insensibly polish the Mind, where the Example of the Female Softness and Modesty must communicate itself to their Admirers, and where the Delicacy of that Sex puts every one on his Guard, lest he give Offence by any Breach of Decency?

I MUST confess, That my own particular Choice rather leads me to prefer the Company of a few select Companions, with whom I can, calmly and peaceably, enjoy the Feast of Reason, and try the Justness of every Reflection, whether gay or serious, that may occur to me.  But as such a delightful Society is not every Day to be met with, I must think, that mixt Companies, without the Fair-Sex, are the most insipid Entertainment in the World, and destitute of Gaiety and Politeness, as much as of Sense and Reason.  Nothing can keep them from excessive Dulness but hard Drinking; a Remedy worse than the Disease.

AMONG the Antients, the Character of the Fair-Sex was consider'd as altogether domestic, nor were they regarded as Part of the polite World, or of good Company.  This, perhaps, is the true Reason why the Antients have not left us one Piece of Pleasantry, that is excellent, (unless one may except the Banquet of _Xenophon_, and some Dialogues of _Lucian_) tho' many of their serious Compositions are altogether inimitable.  _Horace_ condemns the coarse Railleries and cold Jests of _Plautus_:  But, are his own much more entertaining?  This, therefore, is one considerable Improvement, which the polite Arts have receiv'd from Gallantry, and from Courts, where it first arose.

THE Point of _Honour_ is a modern Invention, as well as _Gallantry_; and by some esteemed equally useful for the refining of Manners:  But how it has contributed to that Effect, I am at a Loss to determine.  Conversation, among the greatest Rustics, is not commonly infested with such Rudeness as can give       Occasion to Duels, even according to the most refined Laws of this fantastic Honour; and as to the other smaller Indecencies, which are the most offensive, because the most frequent, they can never be cur'd by the Practice of Duelling.  But these Notions are not only _useless_ but _pernicious_.  By separating the Man of Honour from the Man of Virtue, the greatest Profligates have got something to value themselves upon, and have been able to keep themselves in Countenance, tho' guilty of the most shameful and most dangerous Vices.  They are Debauchees, Spendthrifts, and never pay a Farthing they owe:  But they are Men of Honour; and therefore are to be receiv'd as Gentlemen in all Companies.

THERE are some of the Parts of modern Honour, which are the most essential Parts of Morality; such as Fidelity, the observing Promises, and telling Truth.  These Points of Honour Mr. _Addison_ had in his Eye, when he made _Juba_ say,

/Honour's a sacred Tye, the Law of Kings,

The noble Mind's distinguishing Perfection,

That aids and strengthens Virtue, when it meets her,

And imitates her Actions where she is not:

It ought not to be sported with\.

These Lines are very beautiful:  But I am afraid, that Mr. _Addison_ has here been guilty of that Impropriety of Sentiment with which he has so justly reproach'd other Poets.  The Antients certainly never had any Notion of _Honour_ as distinct from _Virtue_. BUT, to return from this Digression, I shall advance it as a _fourth_ Observation on this Head, of the Rise and Progress of the Arts and Sciences, _That when the Arts and Sciences come to Perfection in any State, from that Moment they naturally, or rather necessarily decline, and seldom or never revive in that Nation, where they formerly flourish'd_.

IT must be confest, that this Maxim, tho' conformable to Experience, may, at first Sight, be esteem'd very contrary to Reason.  If the natural Genius of Mankind be the same in all Ages, and in almost all Countries, (as I am of Opinion it is) it must very much forward and cultivate this Genius, to be possest of exact Models in every Art, to regulate the Taste, and fix the Objects of Imitation.  The Models left us by the Antients gave Birth to all the Arts about 200 Years ago, and have mightily advanc'd their Progress in every Country of _Europe_:  Why had they not a like Effect during the Reign of _Trajan_ and his Successors, when they were much more entire, and were still admir'd and study'd by the whole World?  So late as the Emperor _Justinian_, the POET, by Way of Distinction, was understood, among the _Greeks_, to be _Homer_; among the _Romans, Virgil_.  Such Admiration still remain'd for these divine Geniuses; tho' no Poet had appear'd for many Centuries, who cou'd justly pretend to have imitated them.

A MAN's Genius is always, in the Beginning of his Life, as much unknown to himself as to others; and 'tis only after frequent Trials, attended with Success, that he dare think himself equal to those Undertakings, in which they who have succeeded, have fixt the Admiration of Mankind.  If his own Nation be already possest of many glorious Models of Eloquence, he naturally compares his own juvenile Exercises with these; and being sensible of the infinite Disproportion betwixt them, is discouraged from any further Attempts, and never dares aspire to a Rivalship with those Authors, whom he so much admires.  A noble Emulation is the Source of every Excellence.  Admiration and Modesty naturally extinguish this Emulation.  And no one is so liable to an Excess of Admiration and Modesty, as a truly great Genius. NEXT to Emulation, the greatest Encourager of the noble Arts is Praise and Glory.  A Writer is animated with new Force, when he hears the Applauses of the World for his former Productions; and, being rouz'd by such a Motive, he often reaches a Pitch of Perfection, which is equally surprising to himself and to his Readers.  But when the Posts of Honour are all occupy'd, his first Attempts are but coldly receiv'd by the Public, being compar'd to Productions, which are both in themselves more excellent, and have already the Advantage of an establish'd Reputation.  Were _Moliere_ or _Corneille_ to bring upon the Stage at present their early Productions, which were formerly so well receiv'd, 'twou'd discourage the young Poets, to see the Indifference and Disdain of the Public.  The Ignorance of the Age alone cou'd have given Admission to the _Prince of Tyre_; but 'tis to that we owe _the Moor_:  Had _every Man in his Humour_ been rejected, we had never seen _Volpone_.

PERHAPS it may not be for the Advantage of any Nation, to have the Arts imported from their Neighbours in too great Perfection.  This extinguishes Emulation, and sinks the Ardour of the generous Youth.  So many perfect Models of _Italian_ Painting brought into _Great Britain_, instead of exciting our Artists, is the Cause of their small Progress in that noble Art.  The same, perhaps, was the Case of _Rome_, when it receiv'd the Arts from _Greece_.  That Multitude of finish'd Productions in the _French_ Language, disperst all over _Germany_ and the North, hinder these Nations from cultivating their own Language, and keep them still dependent on their Neighbours for those elegant Entertainments.

'TIS true, the Antients had left us Models in every Kind of Writing, which are highly worthy of Admiration.  But besides that they were wrote in Languages, which were known only to the Learn'd; besides this, I say, the Comparison is not so perfect nor intire betwixt modern Wits, and those who liv'd in so remote an Age.  Had _Waller_ been born in _Rome_, during the Reign of _Tiberius_, his first Productions had been despis'd, when compared to the finish'd Odes of _Horace_.  But in this Island the Superiority of the _Roman_ Poet diminish'd nothing from the Fame of the _English_.  We thought ourselves sufficiently happy, that  our Climate and Language cou'd produce but a faint Copy of so excellent an Original.

IN short, the Arts and Sciences, like some Plants, require a fresh Soil; and however rich the Land may be, and however you may recruit it by Art or Care, it will never, when once exhausted, produce any Thing that is perfect or finish'd in the Kind.

For Instance, What Absurdity wou'd it be to assert, that _Virgil_ understood not the Force of the Terms he imploys, and cou'd not chuse his Epithets with Propriety; because in the following Lines, addrest also to _Augustus_, he has fail'd in that Particular, and has ascrib'd to the _Indians_ a Quality, which seems, in a Manner, to turn his Hero into Ridicule.

ESSAY VI.

_The_ EPICUREAN <1>.

'TIS a great Mortification to the Vanity of Man, that his utmost Art and Industry can never equal the meanest of Nature's Productions, either for Beauty or Value.  Art is only the Underworkman, and is imploy'd to give a few Strokes of Embellishment to those Pieces, which come from the Hand of the Master.  Some of the Drapery may be of his Drawing; but he is not allow'd to touch the principal Figure.  Art may make a Suit of Clothes:  But Nature must produce a Man.

EVEN in those Productions, which are commonly denominated Works of Art, we find, that the noblest of the Kind are beholden for their chief Beauty to the Force and happy Influence of Nature.  To the _Oestrum_ or _Verve_ of the Poets, we owe whatever is admirable in their Productions.  The greatest Genius, where Nature at any Time fails him (for she is not equal) throws aside the Lyre, and hopes not, from the Rules of Art, to reach that Divine Harmony, which must proceed from her Inspiration alone.  How poor are those Songs, where a happy Flow of Fancy has not furnish'd Materials for Art to embellish and refine!

BUT of all the fruitless Attempts of Art, no one is so ridiculous, as that which the severe Philosophers have undertaken, the producing an _artificial Happiness_, and making us be pleased by Rules of Reason, and by Reflection.  Why did none of them claim the Reward, which _Xerxes_ promis'd to any one, that cou'd invent a new Pleasure.  Unless, perhaps, they invented so many Pleasures for their own Use, that they despis'd Riches, and stood in no need of any Pleasures, which the Rewards of that Monarch cou'd procure them.  I am apt, indeed, to think, that they were not willing to furnish the Court of _Persia_ with a new Pleasure, by presenting it with so new and unusual an Object of Ridicule.  Their Speculations, when confin'd to Theory, and gravely deliver'd in the Schools of _Greece_, might excite Admiration in their ignorant Pupils:  But the attempting to reduce such Principles to Practice wou'd soon betray their Absurdity.

YOU pretend to make me happy by Reason, and by Rules of Art.  You must, then, create me anew by Rules of Art.  For on my inward Frame and Structure does my Happiness depend.  But you want Power to effectuate this; and Skill too, I am afraid:  Nor can I entertain a less Opinion of Nature's Wisdom than of yours.  And let her conduct the Machine, which she has so wisely fram'd.  I find, that I shou'd only spoil it by my tampering.

TO what Purpose shou'd I pretend to regulate, refine, or invigorate any of those Springs or Principles, which Nature has implanted in me?  Is this the Road, by which I must reach Happiness?  But Happiness implies Ease, Contentment, Repose and Pleasure; not Watchfulness, Care, and Fatigue.  The Health of my Body consists in the Facility with which all its Operations are perform'd.  The Stomach digests the Aliments:  The Heart circulates the Blood:  The Brain separates and refines the Spirits:  And all this without my concerning myself in the Matter.  When by my Will alone I can stop the Blood, as it runs with Impetuosity along its Canals, then may I hope to change the Course of my Sentiments and Passions.  In vain shou'd I strain my Faculties, and endeavour to receive Pleasure from an Object, which is not fitted by Nature to affect my Organs with Delight.  I may give myself Pain by my fruitless Endeavours; but shall never reach any Pleasure.

AWAY then with all those vain Pretences of making ourselves happy within ourselves, of feasting on our own Thoughts, of being satisfy'd with the Consciousness of Well-doing, and of despising all Assistance and all Supplies from external Objects.  This is the Voice of PRIDE, not of NATURE.  And 'twere well, if even this Pride cou'd support itself, and communicate a real _inward_ Pleasure, however melancholy or severe.  But this impotent Pride can do no more than regulate the _Outside_; and with infinite Pains and Attention compose the Language and Countenance to a Philosophical Dignity, in order to deceive the ignorant Vulgar.  The Heart, mean while, is

empty of all Enjoyment:  And the Mind, unsupported by its proper Objects, sinks down into the deepest Sorrow and Melancholy.  Miserable, but vain Mortal!  Thy Mind be happy within itself!  With what Resources is it endow'd to fill so immense a Void, and supply the Place of all thy bodily Senses and Faculties?  Can thy Head subsist without thy other Members?  In such a Situation,

/What foolish Figure must it make?

Do nothing else but\ sleep _and_ ake.

Into such a Lethargy, or such a Melancholy, must thy Mind be plung'd, when depriv'd of foreign Occupations and Enjoyments.

KEEP me, therefore, no longer in this violent Constraint.  Confine me not within myself; but point out to me those Objects and Pleasures, which afford the chief Enjoyment.  But why do I apply to you, proud and ignorant Sages, to show me the Road to Happiness?  Let me consult my own Passions and Inclinations.  In them must I read the Dictates of Nature; not in your frivolous Discourses.

BUT see, propitious to my Wishes, the divine, the amiable <2> PLEASURE, the supreme Love of GODS and Men, advances towards me.  At her Approach, my Heart beats with genial Heat, and every Sense and every Faculty is dissolv'd in Joy; while she pours around me all the Embellishments of the Spring, and all the Treasures of the Autumn.  The Melody of her Voice charms my Ears with the softest Music, as she invites me to partake of those delicious Fruits, which, with a Smile that diffuses a Glory on the Heavens and the Earth, she presents to me.  The sportive _Cupids_, that attend her, or fan me with their odoriferous Wings, or pour on my Head the most fragrant  Oils, or offer me their sparkling Nectar in golden Goblets.  O! for ever let me spread my Limbs on this Bed of Roses, and thus, thus feel the delicious Moments, with soft and downy Steps, glide along.  But cruel Chance!  Whither do you fly so fast?  Why do my ardent Wishes, and that Load of Pleasures, which you labour under, rather hasten, than retard your unrelenting Pace?  Suffer me to enjoy this soft Repose, after all my Fatigues in Search of Happiness.  Suffer me to satiate myself with

these Delicacies, after the Pains of so long and so foolish an Abstinence.

BUT 'twill not do.  The Roses have lost their Hue:  The Fruit its Flavour:  And that delicious Wine, whose Fumes, so late, intoxicated all my Senses with such Delight, does now in vain sollicite the sated Palate.  _Pleasure_ smiles at my Languour.  She beckens to her Sister, _Virtue_, to come to her Assistance.  The gay, the frolic _Virtue_ hears her Voice, and brings along the whole Troop of my jovial Friends.  Welcome, thrice welcome, my ever dear Companions, to these shady Bowers, and to this luxurious Repaste.  Your Presence has restor'd to the Rose its Hue, and to the Fruit its Flavour.  The Vapours of this sprightly Nectar do now again play around my Heart; while you partake of my Delights, and discover, in your chearful Looks, the Pleasure you receive from my Happiness and Satisfaction.  The like do I receive from yours; and encourag'd by your joyous Presence, shall again renew the Feast, with which, from too much Enjoyment, my Senses were well-nigh sated; while the Mind kept not pace with the Body,

nor afforded Relief to her o'er-burthen'd Partner.

IN our chearful Discourses, better than in the formal Reasonings of the Schools, is true Wisdom to be found.  In our friendly Endearments, better than in the hollow Debates of Statesmen and pretended Patriots, does true Virtue display itself.  Forgetful of the past, secure of the future, let us here enjoy the present; and while we yet possess a Being, let us fix some Good, beyond the Power of Fate or Fortune.  To-morrow will bring its own Pleasures along with it:  But shou'd it disappoint our fond Wishes, we shall at least enjoy the Pleasure of reflecting on the Pleasures of To-day.

FEAR not, my Friends, that the barbarous Dissonance of _Bacchus_, and of his Revellers, shou'd break in upon this Entertainment, and confound us with their horrid Discord.  The sprightly Muses wait around; and with their charming Symphony, sufficient to soften the Wolves and Tygers of the savage Desart, inspire a soft Joy into every Bosom.  Peace, Harmony, and Concord reign in this Retreat; nor is the Silence ever broke but by the Music of our Songs, or the chearful Accents of our friendly Voices.

BUT hark! the Favourite of the Muses, the gentle _Damon_, strikes the Lyre; and while he accompanies its harmonious Notes with his more harmonious Song, he inspires us with the same happy Debauch of Fancy, by which he is himself transported.  "Ye favour'd of Heaven <3>, he sings, while the wanton Spring pours upon you all her blooming Honours, let not _Glory_ seduce you, with her delusive Blaze, to pass in Perils and Dangers this delicious Season, this Prime of Life.  Wisdom points out to you the Road to Pleasure:  Nature too beckens to you to follow her in that smooth and flowry Path.  Will you shut your Ears to their commanding Voice?  Will you harden your Heart to their soft Allurements?  Oh, deluded Mortals, thus to lose your Youth; thus to throw away so invaluable a Present, to trifle with

so perishing a Blessing.  Contemplate well your Recompence.  Consider that Glory, which so allures your proud Hearts, and seduces you with your own Praises.  'Tis an Eccho, a Dream, nay the Shadow of a Dream, which is dissipated by every Wind, and lost by every contrary Breath of the ignorant and ill-judging Multitude.  You fear not, that even Death itself will ravish it from you.  But behold! while you are yet alive, Calumny bereaves you of it, Ignorance neglects it; Nature enjoys it not; Fancy alone, renouncing every Pleasure, receives this airy Recompence, empty and unstable as itself."

THUS the Hours pass unperceiv'd along, and lead in their wanton Train all the Pleasures of Sense, and all the Joys of Harmony and Friendship.  Smiling _Innocence_ closes the Procession; and while she presents herself to our ravish'd Eyes, she embellishes the whole Scene, and renders the View of these Pleasures as transporting, after they have past us, as when, with laughing Countenances, they were yet advancing towards us. BUT the Sun has sunk below the Horizon; and Darkness, stealing silently upon us, has now bury'd all Nature in an universal Shade.  "Rejoice, my Friends; continue your Repaste, or change it for soft Repose.  Tho' absent, your Joy or your Tranquility shall still be mine."  _But whither do you go?  Or what new Pleasures call you from our Society?  Is there aught agreeable without your Friends?  And can aught please, in which we partake not_?  "Yes, my Friends; the Joy, which I now seek, admits not of your Participation.  Here alone I wish your Absence:  And here alone can I find a sufficient Compensation for the Loss of your Society.

BUT I have not advanc'd far thro' the Shades of the thick Wood, which spreads a double Night around me, e're, methinks, I perceive thro' the Gloom, the charming _Caelia_, the Mistress of my Wishes, who wanders impatient thro' the Grove, and preventing the appointed Hour, silently chides my tardy Steps.  But the Joy, which she receives from my Presence, best pleads my Excuse; and, dissipating every anxious and every angry Thought,

leaves Room for nought but mutual Joy and Rapture.  With what Words, my fair one, shall I express my Tenderness, or describe the Emotions which now warm my transported Bosom!  Words are too faint to describe my Love; and if, alas!  you feel not the same Flame within you, in vain shall I endeavour to convey to you a just Conception of it.  But your every Word and every Motion suffice to remove this Doubt; and while they express your Passion, serve also to enflame mine.  How amiable this Solitude, this Silence, this Darkness!  No Objects now importune the ravish'd Soul.  The Thought, the Sense, all full of nothing but our mutual Happiness, do wholly possess the Mind, and convey a Pleasure, which deluded Mortals vainly seek for in every other Enjoyment.---------

BUT why, after our tumultuous Joys, does your Bosom heave with these Sighs, while Tears bathe your glowing Cheeks?  Why distract your Heart with such vain Anxieties?  Why so often ask me, _How long my Love shall yet endure_?  Alas, my _Caelia_, can I resolve this Question?  /Do I know how long my Life shall

yet endure\?  But does this also disturb your tender Breast?  And is the Image of our frail Mortality for ever present with you, to throw a Damp on your gayest Hours, and poison even those Joys which Love inspires.  Consider rather, that if Life be frail, if Youth be transitory, we shou'd well employ the present Moment, and lose no Part of so perishable an Existence.  Yet a little Moment, and _these_ shall be no more.  We shall be, as if we had never been.  Not a Memory of us be left upon Earth; and even the fabulous Shades below will not afford us a Habitation.  Our fruitless Anxieties, our vain Projects, our uncertain Speculations shall all be swallow'd up and lost.  Our present Doubts, concerning the original Cause of all Things, must never, alas! be resolv'd.  This alone we may be certain of, that if any governing Mind preside over the Universe, he must be pleas'd to see us fulfil the Ends of our Being, and enjoy that Pleasure, for which alone we were created.  Let this Reflection give Ease to your anxious Thoughts; but do not render your Joys too serious, by dwelling for ever upon it.  'Tis sufficient, once for all, to be acquainted with this Philosophy, in order

to give an unbounded Loose to Love and Jollity, and remove all the Scruples of a vain Superstition:  But while Youth and Passion, my Fair-one, prompt our eager Desires, we must find gayer Subjects of Discourse, to intermix with these amorous Caresses.

ESSAY VII.

_The_ STOIC <1>.

THERE is this obvious and material Difference in the Conduct of Nature, with regard to Man and other Animals, that having endow'd the former with a sublime celestial Spirit, and having given him an Affinity with superior Beings, she allows not such noble Faculties to ly lethargic or idle; but urges him, by Necessity, to employ, on every Emergence, his utmost _Art_ and _Industry_.  Brute Creatures have many of their Necessities supply'd by Nature, being cloath'd and arm'd by this beneficent Parent of all Things:  And where their own _Industry_ is requisite on any Occasion, Nature, by implanting Instincts, still supplies them with the _Art_, and guides them to their Good, by her unerring Precepts.  But Man, expos'd naked and indigent to the rude Elements, rises slowly from that helpless State, by the Care and Vigilance of his Parents; and having attain'd his utmost Growth and Perfection, reaches only a Capacity of subsisting, by his own Care and Vigilance.  Every Thing is sold to Skill and Labour; and where Nature furnishes the Materials, they are still rude and unfinish'd, till Industry, ever active and intelligent, refines them from their brute State, and fits them for human Use and Convenience.

ACKNOWLEDGE, therefore, O Man, the Beneficence of Nature:  For she has given thee that Intelligence which supplies all thy Necessities.  But let not Indolence, under the false Appearance of Gratitude, perswade thee to rest contented with her Presents.  Wou'd'st thou return to the raw Herbage for thy Food, to the open Sky for thy Covering, and to Stones and Clubs for thy Defence against the revenous Animals of the Desert?  Then return also to thy savage Manners, to thy timorous Superstition, to thy brutal Ignorance; and sink thyself below those Animals, whose Condition thou admirest, and wou'd'st so fondly imitate. THY kind Parent, Nature, having given thee Art and Intelligence, has fill'd the whole Globe with Materials for these Talents to work upon:  Hearken to her Voice, which so plainly tells thee, that thou thyself shou'd'st also be the Object of thy Industry, and that by Art and Attention thou can'st alone acquire that Ability, which will raise thee to thy proper Station in the Universe.  Behold this Artizan, who converts a rude and shapeless Stone into a noble Metal; and molding that Metal by his cunning Hands, creates, as it were by Magic, every Weapon for his Defence, and every Utensil for his Convenience.  He has not this Skill from Nature:  Use and Practice have taught it him:  And if thou wou'd'st emulate his Success, thou must follow his laborious Footsteps.

BUT while thou _ambitiously_ aspirest to the perfecting thy bodily Powers and Faculties, wou'd'st thou _meanly_ neglect thy Mind, and from a preposterous Sloth, leave it still rude and uncultivated, as it came from the Hands of Nature?  Far be such Folly and Negligence from every rational Being.  If Nature has been frugal in her Gifts and Endowments, there is the more Need of Art to supply her Defects.  If she has been generous and liberal, know that she still expects Industry and Application on our Part, and revenges herself in Proportion to our negligent Ingratitude.  The richest Genius, like the most fertile Soil, when uncultivated, shoots up into the rankest Weeds; and instead of Vines and Olives for the Pleasure and Use of Man, produces to its slothful Owner the most abundant Crop of Poisons.

THE great End of all human Industry, is the Attainment of Happiness.  For this were Arts invented, Sciences cultivated, Laws ordain'd, and Societies modell'd, by the profoundest Wisdom of Patriots and Legislators.  Even the lonely Savage, who lyes expos'd to the Inclemency of the Elements, and the Fury of wild Beasts, forgets not, for a Moment, this grand Object of his Being.  Ignorant as he is of every Art of Life, he keeps still in View the End of all those Arts, and eagerly seeks for Felicity amidst that Darkness with which he is environ'd.  But as much  as the wildest Savage is inferior to the polish'd Citizen, who under the Protection of Laws enjoys every Convenience that Industry has invented; so much is this Citizen himself inferior to the Man of Virtue, and the true Philosopher, who governs his Appetites, subdues his Passions, and has learn'd, from Reason, to set a just Value on every Pursuit and Enjoyment.  For is there an Art and Apprenticeship requisite for every other Attainment?  And is there no Art of Life, no Rule, no Precepts to direct us in this principal Concern?  Can no particular Pleasure be attain'd without Skill; and can the Whole be regulated without Reflection or Intelligence, by the blind Guidance of Appetite and Instinct?  Surely then no Mistakes are ever committed in this Affair; but every Man, however dissolute and negligent, proceeds in the Pursuit of Happiness, with as unerring a Motion, as that which the celestial Bodies observe, when, conducted by the Hand of the Almighty, they roll along the etherial Plains.  But if Mistakes be often, be inevitably committed, let us register these Mistakes; let us consider their Causes; let us weigh their Importance; let us enquire for their Remedies.  When from this we have fix'd all the Rules of Conduct, we are _Philosophers_:  When we have reduc'd these Rules to Practice, we are _Sages_. LIKE many subordinate Artists, imploy'd to form the several Wheels and Springs of a Machine:  Such are those who excel in all the particular Arts of Life.  _He_ is the Master-Workman, who puts those several Parts together, moves them according to just Harmony and Proportion, and produces true Felicity, as the Result of their conspiring Order.

WHILE you have such an alluring Object in View, Shall that Labour and Attention, which is requisite to the attaining your End, ever seem burdensome and intolerable?  Know, that this Labour itself is the chief Ingredient of the Felicity to which you aspire, and that every Enjoyment soon becomes insipid and distasteful, when not acquir'd by Travel and Fatigue.  See the hardy Hunters rise from their downy Couches, shake off the Slumbers that still weigh down their heavy Eye-lids, and, e'er _Aurora_ has yet cover'd the Heavens with her flaming Mantle, hasten to the Forest.  They leave behind, in their own Houses, and in the neighbouring Plains, Animals of every Kind, whose Flesh furnishes the most delicious Fare, and which offer themselves to the fatal Stroke.  Laborious Man disdains so easy a Purchase.  He seeks for a Prey, that hides itself from his Search, or flies from his Pursuit, or defends itself from his Violence.  Having exerted in the Chace every Passion of the Mind, and every Member of the Body, he then finds the Charms of Repose, and with Joy compares its Pleasures to those of his engaging Labours.

AND can vigorous Industry give Pleasure to the Pursuit even of the most worthless Prey, which frequently escapes our Toils?  And cannot the same Industry render the Cultivation of our Mind, the moderating of our Passions, the enlightening of our Reason, an agreeable Occupation; while we are every Day sensible of our Progress, and behold our inward Features and Countenance brightening incessantly with new Charms?  Begin by curing yourself of this lethargic Indolence; the Task is not difficult:  You need but taste the Sweets of honest Labour.  Proceed to learn the just Value of every Pursuit; Long Study is not requisite:  Compare, tho' but for once, the Mind to the Body, Virtue to Fortune, and Glory to Pleasure, you will then perceive the Advantages of Industry:  You will then be sensible what are the proper Objects of your Industry.

IN vain do you seek Repose from Beds of Roses:  In vain do you hope for Enjoyment from the most delicious Wines and Fruits.  Your Indolence itself becomes a Fatigue:  Your Pleasure itself creates Disgust.  The Mind, unexercis'd, finds every Delight insipid and loathsome; and e'er yet the Body, full of noxious Humours, feels the Torment of its multiply'd Diseases, your nobler Part is sensible of the invading Poison, and seeks in vain to relieve its Anxiety by new Pleasures, which still augment the fatal Malady.

I NEED not tell you, that by this eager Pursuit of Pleasure, you more and more expose yourself to Fortune and Accidents, and rivet your Affections on external Objects, which Chance may, in a Moment, ravish from you.  I shall suppose, that your indulgent Stars favour you still with the Enjoyment of your Riches and Possessions.  I prove to you, that even in the midst of your luxurious Pleasures, you are unhappy; and that, by too much Indulgence, you are incapable of enjoying what prosperous Fortune still allows you to possess.

BUT surely the Instability of Fortune is a Consideration not to be overlook'd or neglected.  Happiness cannot possibly exist, where there is no Security; and Security can have no Place, where Fortune has any Dominion.  Tho' that unstable Deity shou'd not exert her Rage against you, the Dread of it wou'd still torment you; wou'd disturb your Slumbers, haunt your Dreams, and throw a Damp on the Jollity of your most delicious Banquets.

THE Temple of Wisdom is seated on a Rock, above the Rage of the fighting Elements, and inaccessible to all the Malice of Man.  The rolling Thunder breaks below; and those more terrible Instruments of human Fury reach not to so sublime a Height.  The Sage, while he breathes that serene Air, looks down with Pleasure, mixt with Compassion, on the Errors of mistaken Mortals, who blindly seek for the true Path of Life, and pursue Riches, Nobility, Honour, or Power for genuine Felicity.  The greatest Part he beholds disappointed of their fond Wishes:  Some lament, that having once possess'd the Object of their Desires, it is ravish'd from them by envious Fortune:  And all complain, that even their own Vows, tho' granted, cannot give them Happiness, or relieve the Anxiety of their distracted Minds.

BUT does the Sage preserve himself always in this philosophic Indifference, and rest contented with lamenting the Miseries of Mankind, without ever imploying himself for their Relief?  Does he constantly indulge this severe Wisdom, which, by pretending to elevate him above human Accidents, does in Reality harden his Heart, and render him careless of the Interests of Mankind, and of Society?  No: he knows, that in this sullen _Apathy_, neither true Wisdom nor true Happiness is to be found.  He feels too strongly the Charm of the social Affections ever to counteract so sweet, so natural, so virtuous a Propensity.  Even when, bath'd in Tears, he laments the Miseries of human Race, of his Country, of his Friends, and unable to give Succour, can only relieve them by Compassion; he yet rejoices in the generous Disposition, and feels a Satisfaction superior to that of the most indulg'd Sense. So engaging are the Sentiments of Humanity, that they brighten up the very Face of Sorrow, and operate like the Sun, which shining on a dusky Cloud or falling Rain, paints on them the most glorious Colours that are to be found in the whole Circle of Nature.

BUT 'tis not here alone, that the social Virtues display their Energy.  With whatever Ingredient you mix them, they are still predominant.  As Sorrow cannot overcome them, so neither can sensual Pleasure obscure them.  The Joys of Love, however furious and tumultuous, banish not the tender Sentiments of Sympathy and Affection.  They even derive their chief Influence from that generous Passion; and when presented alone, afford nothing to the unhappy Mind but Lassitude and Disgust.  Behold this sprightly Debauchee, who professes a Contempt of all other Pleasures but those of Wine and Jollity:  Separate him from his Companions, like a Spark from a Fire, where before it contributed to the general Blaze:  His Alacrity suddenly extinguishes; and tho' surrounded with every other Means of Delight, he lothes the sumptuous Banquet, and prefers even the most abstract Study and Speculation, as more agreeable and entertaining.

BUT the social Passions never afford such transporting Pleasures, or make so glorious an Appearance in the Eyes both of GOD and Man, as when, shaking off every earthly Mixture, they associate themselves with the Sentiments of Virtue, and prompt us to laudable and worthy Actions.  As harmonious Colours mutually give and receive a Lustre by their friendly Union; so do these ennobling Sentiments of the human Mind.  See the Triumph of Nature in parental Affection!  What selfish Passion; what sensual Delights are a Match for it!  Whether a Man exults in the Prosperity and Virtue of his Offspring, or flies to their Succour,  thro' the most threatning and tremenduous Dangers?

PROCEED still in purifying the generous Passion, you will still the more admire its shining Glories.  What Charms are there in the Harmony of Minds, and in a Friendship founded on mutual Esteem and Gratitude!  What Satisfaction in relieving the distrest, in comforting the afflicted, in raising the fallen, and in stopping the Career of cruel Fortune, or of more cruel Man, in their Insults over the good and virtuous!  But what supreme Joy in the Victories over Vice as well as Misery, when, by virtuous Example or wise Exhortation, our Fellow-creatures are taught to govern their Passions, reform their Vices, and subdue their worst Enemies, which inhabit within their own Bosoms!

BUT these Objects are still too limited for the human Mind, which, being of celestial Origin, swells with the divinest and most enlarg'd Affections, and carrying its Attention beyond Kindred and Acquaintance, extends its benevolent Wishes to the most distant Posterity.  It views Liberty and Laws as the Source of human Happiness, and devotes itself, with the utmost Alacrity, to their Guardianship and Protection.  Toils, Dangers, Death itself carry their Charms, when we brave them for the public Good, and ennoble that Being, which we generously sacrifice for the Interests of our Country.  Happy the Man, whom indulgent Fortune allows to pay to Virtue what he owes to Nature, and to make a generous Gift of what must otherwise be ravish'd from him by cruel Necessity. IN the true Sage and Patriot are united whatever can distinguish human Nature, or elevate mortal Man to a Resemblance with the Divinity.  The softest Benevolence, the most undaunted Resolution, the tenderest Sentiments, the most sublime Love of Virtue, all these animate successively his transported Bosom.  What Satisfaction, when he looks within, to find the most turbulent Passions turn'd into just Harmony and Concord, and every jarring Sound banish'd from this enchanting Music!  If the Contemplation, even of inanimate Beauty, be so delightful; if it ravishes the Senses, even when it appears in foreign Objects:  What must be the Effects of moral Beauty?  And what Influence must it have, when it embellishes our own Mind, and is the Result of our own Reflection and Industry?

_BUT where is the Reward of Virtue?  And what Recompence has Nature provided for such important Sacrifices, as those of Life and Fortune, which we must often make to it_?  Oh, Sons of Earth!  Are you ignorant of the Value of this celestial Mistress?  And do you meanly enquire for her Portion, when you observe her genuine Charms?  But know, that Nature has been indulgent to human Weakness, and has not left this Favourite-child naked and unendow'd.  She has provided Virtue of the richest Dowry; but being careful, lest the Allurements of Interest shou'd engage such Suitors, as were insensible of the native Worth of so divine a Beauty, she has wisely provided, that this Dowry can have no Charms but in the Eyes of those who are already transported with the Love of Virtue.  GLORY is the Portion of Virtue, the sweet Reward of honourable Toils, the triumphant Crown, that covers the thoughtful Head of the disinterested Patriot, or the dusty Brow of the victorious Warrior.  Elevate by so sublime a Prize, the Man of Virtue looks down with Contempt on all the Allurements of Pleasure, and all the Menaces of Danger.  Death itself loses its Terrors, when he considers, that its Dominion extends only over  a Part of him, and that, in Spite of Death and Time, the Rage of the Elements, and the endless Vicissitude of human Affairs, he is assur'd of an immortal Fame among all the Sons of Men.

THERE surely is a Being that presides over the Universe; and, with infinite Wisdom and Power, has reduc'd the jarring Elements into just Order and Proportion.  Let speculative Reasoners dispute, how far this beneficent Being extends his Care of Virtue, and whether he prolongs our Existence to a future State, in order to bestow on it its just Reward, and render it fully triumphant.  The Man of Virtue, without deciding any Thing on so dubious a Subject, is satisfy'd with that Portion which is mark'd out to him by the supreme Disposer of all Things.  Gratefully he accepts of that farther Reward prepar'd for him; but if disappointed, he thinks not Virtue an empty Name; but justly esteeming it to be its own Reward, he gratefully acknowledges the Bounty of his Creator, who by calling him forth into Existence, has thereby afforded him an Opportunity of once acquiring so invaluable a Possession.

ESSAY VIII.

_The_ PLATONIST <1>.

TO some Philosophers it appears Matter of Surprize, that all Mankind, possessing the same Nature, and being endow'd with the same Faculties, shou'd yet differ so widely in their Pursuits and Inclinations, and that one shou'd utterly condemn what is fondly sought after by another.  To some it appears Matter of still more Surprize, that Man shou'd differ so widely from himself at different Times; and, after Possession, reject with Disdain  what, before, was the Object of all his Vows and Wishes.  To me this feverish Uncertainty and Irresolution, in human Conduct, seems altogether unavoidable; nor can a rational Soul, made for the Contemplation of the supreme Being, and of his Works, ever enjoy Tranquillity or Satisfaction, while detain'd in the ignoble Pursuits of sensual Pleasure or popular Applause.  The Divinity is a boundless Ocean of Bliss and Glory:  Human Minds are smaller Streams, which, arising at first from this Ocean, seek still, amid all their Wanderings, to return to it, and to lose themselves in that Immensity of Perfection.  When check'd in this natural Course, by Vice or Folly, they become furious and enrag'd; and, swelling to a Torrent, do then spread Horror and Devastation on the neighbouring Plains.

IN vain, by pompous Phrase and passionate Expressions, does each recommend his own Pursuit, and invite the credulous Hearers to an Imitation of his Life and Manners.  The Heart belies the Countenance, and sensibly feels, even amid the highest Success, the unsatisfactory Nature of all those Pleasures, which detain it from its true Object.  I examine the voluptuous Man before Enjoyment; I measure the Vehemence of his Desire, and the Importance of his Object; I find that all his Happiness proceeds only from that Hurry of Thought which takes him from himself, and turns his View from his Guilt and Misery.  I consider him a Moment after; he has now enjoy'd the Pleasure, which he fondly sought after.  The Sense of his Guilt and Misery returns upon him with double Anguish:  His Mind tormented with Fear and Remorse; his Body depress'd with Disgust and Satiety.

BUT a more august, at least, a more haughty Personage presents himself boldly to our Censure; and, assuming the Title of a Philosopher and Man of Morals, offers to submit to the most rigid Examination.  He challenges, with a visible, tho' conceal'd Impatience, our Approbation and Applause; and seems offended, that we shou'd hesitate a Moment before we break out into Admiration of his Virtue.  Seeing this Impatience, I hesitate still more:  I begin to examine the Motives of his seeming Virtue:  But behold! e'er I can enter upon this Enquiry, he flings himself from me; and addressing his Discourse to that Crowd of heedless Auditors, fondly abuses them by his magnificent Pretensions.

O PHILOSOPHER! thy Wisdom is vain, and thy Virtue unprofitable.  Thou seekest the ignorant Applauses of Men, not the solid Reflections of thy own Conscience, or the more solid Approbation of that Being, who, with one Regard of his all-seeing Eye, penetrates the Universe.  Thou surely art conscious of the Hollowness of thy pretended Probity, whilst calling thyself a Citizen, a Son, a Friend, thou forgettest thy higher Sovereign, thy true Father, thy greatest Benefactor.  Where is the Adoration due to such infinite Perfection, whence every Thing good and valuable is deriv'd?  Where is the Gratitude, due to thy Creator, who call'd thee forth from nothing, who plac'd thee in all these Relations to thy Fellow-Creatures, and requiring thee to fulfil the Duty of each Relation, forbids thee to neglect what thou owest to himself, the most perfect Being, to whom thou art connected by the closest Tye?

BUT thou art thyself thy own Idol:  Thou worshippest thy _imaginary_ Perfections:  Or rather, sensible of thy _real_ Imperfections, thou seekest only to deceive the World, and to please thy Fancy, by multiplying thy ignorant Admirers.  Thus not contented with neglecting what is most excellent in the Universe, thou desirest to substitute in his Place what is most vile and contemptible. CONSIDER all the Works of Men's Hands; all the Inventions of human Wit, in which thou affectest so nice a Discernment:  Thou wilt find, that the most perfect Production still proceeds from the most perfect Thought, and that 'tis MIND alone, which we admire, while we bestow our Applause on the Graces of a well-proportion'd Statue, or the Symmetry of a noble Pile.  The Statuary, the Architect comes still in View, and makes us reflect on the Beauty of his Art and Contrivance, which, from a Heap of unform'd Matter, cou'd extract such Expressions and Proportions.  This superior Beauty of Thought and Intelligence thou thyself acknowledgest, while thou invitest us to contemplate, in thy Conduct, the Harmony of Affections, the Dignity of Sentiments, and all those Graces of a Mind, which chiefly merit our Attention.  But why stoppest thou short?  Seest thou nothing farther that is valuable?  Amid thy rapturous Applauses of Beauty and Order, art thou still ignorant where the most consummate Beauty, the most perfect Order, is to be found?  Compare the Works of Art with those of Nature.  The one are but an Imitation of the other.  The nearer Art approaches to Nature, the more perfect is it esteem'd.  But still, how wide are its nearest Approaches, and what an immense Interval may be observ'd betwixt them?  Art copies only the outside of Nature, leaving the inward and more admirable Springs and Principles; as exceeding her Imitation, as beyond her Comprehension.  Art copies only the minute Productions of Nature, despairing to reach that Grandeur and Magnificence, which are so astonishing in the masterly Works of her Original.  Can we then be so blind, as not to discover a Mind and a Design in the exquisite and in the stupenduous Contrivance of the Universe?  Can we be so stupid, as not to feel the warmest Raptures of Worship and Adoration, upon the Contemplation of that Mind, so infinitely good and wise?

THE most perfect Happiness, surely, must arise from the Contemplation of the most perfect Object.  But what is more perfect than Beauty and Virtue?  And where is Beauty to be found equal to that of the Universe?  Or Virtue, which can be compar'd to the Benevolence and Justice of the Deity?  If aught can diminish the Pleasure of this Contemplation, it must be either the Narrowness of our Faculties, which conceals from us the greatest Part of these Beauties and Perfections; or the Shortness of our Lives, which allows not Time sufficient to instruct us in them.  But 'tis our Comfort, that if we imploy worthily the Faculties here assign'd us, they will be enlarg'd in another State of Existence, so as to render us more suitable Worshippers of our Maker:  And that the Task, which can never be finished in Time, will be the Business of an Eternity.

ESSAY IX.

_The_ SCEPTIC.

I HAVE long entertain'd a great Suspicion, with regard to the Decisions of Philosophers upon all Subjects, and found in myself a greater Inclination to dispute, than assent to their Conclusions; there is one Mistake, to which they seem to be liable, almost without Exception; they confine too much their Principles, and make no Account of that vast Variety, which Nature has so much affected in all her Operations.  When a Philosopher has once laid hold of a favourite Principle, which perhaps accounts for many natural Effects, he will extend the same Principle over the whole Creation, and reduce to it every Phaenomenon, tho' by the most violent and absurd Reasoning.  Our own Mind being narrow and contracted, we cannot extend our Conception to the Variety and Extent of Nature; but imagine, that she is as much bounded in her Operations, as we are in our Speculations.

BUT if ever this Infirmity of Philosophers is to be suspected on any Occasion, 'tis in their Reasonings concerning human Life, and the Methods of attaining Happiness.  In that Case, they are led astray, not only by the Narrowness of their Understandings, but also by that of their Passions.  Almost every one has a predominant Inclination, to which all his other Desires and Affections submit, and which governs him, tho', perhaps, with some Intervals, thro' the whole Course of his Life.  'Tis difficult for him to apprehend, that any Thing which appears totally indifferent to him, can ever give Enjoyment to any Person, or can possess Charms, which altogether escape his Observation.  His own Pursuits are always, in his Account, the most engaging:  The Objects of his Passion, the most valuable:  And the Road he pursues, the only one that leads to Happiness.

BUT wou'd these prejudic'd Reasoners reflect a Moment, there are many obvious Instances and Arguments, sufficient to undeceive them, and make them enlarge their Maxims and Principles.  Do they not see the vast Variety of Inclinations and Pursuits among Mankind, where each seems fully satisfy'd with his own Course of Life, and wou'd esteem it the greatest Unhappiness to be confin'd to that of his Neighbour?  Do they not feel in themselves, that what pleases at one Time, displeases at another, by the Change of Inclination; and that it is not in their Power, by their utmost Efforts, to recal that Taste or Appetite, which formerly bestow'd Charms on what now appears indifferent or disagreeable?  What is the Meaning therefore of those general Preferences of the Town or Country-life, of a Life of Action or one of Pleasure, of Retirement or Society; when, besides the different Inclinations of different Men, every one's Experience may convince him, that each of these Kinds of Life is agreeable in its Turn, and that their Variety or their judicious Mixture, does chiefly contribute to the rendering all of them agreeable.

BUT shall this Business be allow'd to go altogether at Adventures?  And must a Man consult only his Humour and Inclination, in order to determine his Course of Life, without ever employing his Reason, to inform him what Road is preferable, and leads most surely to Happiness?  Is there no Difference then betwixt one Man's Conduct and another?

I ANSWER, There is a great Difference.  One Man, following his Inclinations, in chusing his Course of Life, may imploy much surer Means for succeeding than another, who is led by his Inclination into the same Course of Life, and pursues the same Object.  _Are Riches the chief Object of your Desires_?  Acquire Skill in your Profession; be diligent in the Exercise of it; and enlarge the Circle of your Friends and Acquaintance; avoid Pleasure and Expence, and never be generous, but with a View of gaining more than you cou'd save by Frugality.  _Wou'd you acquire the public Esteem_?  Guard equally against the Extremes of Arrogance and Fawning.  Let it appear that you set a Value upon yourself, but without despising others.  If you fall into either of the Extremes, you either provoke Mens Pride by your Insolence, or teach them to despise you by your timorous Submission, and by the mean Opinion you seem to entertain of yourself.

THESE, you say, are the Maxims of common Prudence and Discretion; what every Parent inculcates on his Child, and what  every Man of Sense pursues in the Course of Life, which he has chosen to himself.--What is it then you desire more?  Do you come to a Philosopher, as to a _cunning Man_, to learn something by Magic or Witchcraft, beyond what can be known by common Prudence and Discretion?--Yes; we come to a Philosopher to be instructed, How we shall chuse our Ends, more than the Means for attaining these Ends:  We want to know, what Desires we shall satisfy, what Passions we shall comply with, what Appetites we shall indulge.  As to the rest, we trust to common Sense, and the general Maxims of the World, for our Instruction.

I AM sorry, then, I have pretended to be a Philosopher:  For I find your Questions very perplexing; and am in Danger, if my Answer be too rigid and severe, of passing for a Pedant and Scholastic; if it be too easy and free, of being taken for a Preacher of Vice and Immorality.  However, to satisfy you, I shall deliver my Opinion upon the Matter, and only desire you to esteem it of as little Consequence as I do myself.  By that Means you will neither think it worthy of your Ridicule nor your Anger.

IF we can depend upon any Principle, which we learn from Philosophy, this, I think, may be consider'd as certain and undoubted, That there is nothing, in itself, valuable or despicable, desireable or hateful, beautiful or deformed; but that these Attributes arise from the particular Constitution and Fabric of human Sentiments and Affections.  What seems the most delicious Food to one Animal, appears loathsome to another:  What affects the feeling of one with Delight, produces Uneasiness to another.  This is confessedly the Case with Regard to all the bodily Senses:  But if we examine the Matter more accurately, we shall find, that the same Observation holds even where the Mind concurs with the Body, and mingles its Sentiments with the exterior Appetites. DESIRE this passionate Lover to give you a Character of his Mistress:  He will tell you, that he is at a Loss for Words to describe her Charms, and will ask you very seriously, If ever you was acquainted with a Goddess or an Angel?  If you answer, that you never was:  He will then say, That 'tis impossible for you to form a Conception of such divine Beauties as those his Charmer possesses; so complete a Shape; such proportion'd Features; so engaging an Air; such a Sweetness of Disposition; such Gaiety of Humour.  You can infer nothing, however, from all this Discourse, but that the poor Man is in Love; and that the general Appetite betwixt the Sexes, which Nature has infus'd into all Animals, is in him determin'd to a particular Object by some Qualities, which gave him Pleasure.  The same divine Creature, not only to a different Animal, but also to a different Man, appears a mere mortal Being, and is beheld with the utmost Indifference.

NATURE has given all Animals a like Prejudice in Favour of their Offspring.  As soon as the helpless Infant sees the Light, tho' in every other Eye it appears a despicable and a miserable Creature, it is regarded by its fond Parents with the utmost Affection, and is prefer'd to every other Object, however perfect or accomplish'd.  The Passion alone, arising from the original Structure and Formation of human Nature, bestows a Value on the most insignificant Object.

WE may push the same Observation further, and may conclude, that even when the Mind operates alone, and feeling the Sentiments of Blame or Approbation, pronounces one Object to be deform'd and odious, another beautiful and amiable; I say, that even in that Case, these Qualities are not really in the Objects, but belong entirely to the Sentiments of that Mind which blames or praises.  I grant, that it will be more difficult to make this Proposition evident, and as it were, palpable, to negligent Thinkers; because Nature is more uniform in the Sentiments of the Mind than in most Feelings of the Body, and produces a nearer Resemblance in the inward than in the outward Part of human Kind.  There are somewhat like Principles in mental Taste; and Critics can reason and dispute much more plausibly than Cooks or Perfumers.  This Subject wou'd require a separate Examination.  In the mean Time we may observe, That this Uniformity among human Kind hinders not, but that there is a considerable Diversity in the Sentiments of Beauty and Worth, and that Education, Custom, Prejudice, Caprice, and Humour do frequently vary our Taste of this Kind.  You will never convince a Man, who is not accustom'd to _Italian_ Music, and has not an Ear to follow its Intricacies, that a _Scotch_ Tune is not preferable.  You have not even any single Argument, beyond your own Taste, which you can imploy in your Behalf:  And to your Adversary, his particular Taste will always appear a much more convincing Argument to the contrary.  If you be wise, each of you will allow, that the other may be in the right; and having many other Instances of this Diversity of Taste, you will both confess, that Beauty and Worth are merely of a relative Nature, and consist in an agreeable Sentiment produc'd by an Object on a particular Mind, according to the peculiar Structure and Constitution of that Mind.

BY this Diversity of Sentiment, observable in human Kind, Nature has, perhaps, intended to make us sensible of her Authority, and let us see what surprising Changes she cou'd produce on the Passions and Desires of Mankind, merely by the Change of their inward Fabric, without any Alteration on the Objects.  The Vulgar may even be convinc'd by this Argument:  But Men accustom'd to thinking may draw a more convincing, at least a more general Argument, from the very Nature of the Subject.

IN that Operation, which we call Reasoning, the Mind does nothing but run over its Objects, as they are suppos'd to stand in Reality, without adding any Thing to them, or diminishing any Thing from them.  If I examine the _Ptolomaean_ and _Copernican_ Systems, I endeavour only, by my Enquiries, to know the real Situation of the Planets; that is, in other Words, I endeavour to give them, in my Mind or Conception, the same Relations as they bear towards each other in the Heavens.  To this Operation of the Mind, therefore, there seems to be always a real, tho' often an unknown Standard, in the Nature of Things; nor is Truth or Falshood variable by the various Apprehensions of Mankind. Tho' all human Race shou'd for ever conclude, that the Sun moves, and the Earth remains at rest, the Sun stirs not an Inch from his Place for all these Reasonings; and such Conclusions are eternally false and erroneous.

BUT the Case is not the same with the Qualities of _beautiful and deform'd, desirable and odious_, as with Truth and Falshood.  In the former Case, the Mind is not contented with merely surveying its Objects, as they stand in themselves:  It also feels a Sentiment of Delight or Uneasiness, Approbation or Blame, consequent to that Survey; and this Sentiment determines it to pronounce the Object _beautiful or deform'd, desirable or odious_.  Now, 'tis evident, that this Sentiment must depend upon the particular Fabric or Structure of the Mind, which enables such particular Objects to operate in such a particular Manner, and produces a Sympathy or Conformity betwixt the Mind and the Objects.  Vary the Structure of the Mind or inward Organs, the Sentiment no longer follows, tho' the Objects remain the same.  The Sentiment being different from the Object, and arising from the Operation of the Object upon the Organs of the Mind, an Alteration in any of these Particulars must vary the Effect, nor can the same Object, presented to a Mind totally different, produce the same Sentiment.

THIS Conclusion every one is apt to form of himself, without much Philosophy, where the Sentiment is evidently distinguishable from the Object.  Who is not sensible, that Power, and Glory, and Vengeance, are not desirable of themselves, but derive all their Value from the Structure of human Passions, which begets a Desire for such particular Objects?  But with regard to Beauty, either natural or moral, the Case is commonly suppos'd to be different.  The agreeable Quality is thought to ly in the Object, not in the Sentiment; and that merely because the Sentiment is not so turbulent and violent as to distinguish itself, in an evident Manner, from the Perception of the Object.

BUT a very little Reflection suffices to distinguish them.  A Man may know exactly all the Circles and Ellipses of the _Copernican_ System, and all the irregular Spirals of the _Ptolomaean_, without perceiving that the former is more beautiful than the latter.  _Euclid_ has very fully explain'd all the Qualities of the Circle, but has not, in any Proposition, said a Word of its Beauty.  The Reason is evident.  The Beauty is not a Quality of the Circle.  It lyes not in any Part of the Line, _whose_ Parts are all equally distant from a common Center.  It is only the Effect, which that Figure operates upon the Mind, _whose_ particular Fabric or Structure renders it susceptible of such Sentiments.  In vain wou'd you look for it in the Circle, or seek it, either by your Senses, or by mathematical Reasonings, in all the Properties of that Figure.

THE Mathematician, who took no Pleasure in reading _Virgil_, but that of examining _Aeneas_'s Voyage by the Map, might understand perfectly the Meaning of every _Latin_ Word, imploy'd by that divine Author; and consequently, might have a distinct Idea of the whole Narration.  He wou'd even have a more distinct Idea of it, than they cou'd have who had not study'd so exactly the Geography of the Poem.  He knew, therefore, every Thing in the Poem:  But he was ignorant of its Beauty; because the Beauty, properly speaking, lyes not in the Poem, but in the Sentiment or Taste of the Reader.  And where a Man has no such Sensibility of Temper, as to make him feel this Sentiment, he must be ignorant of the Beauty, tho' he be possess'd of all the Science and Understanding of an Angel <1>.

THE Inference from all this is, That it is not from the Value or Worth of the Object, which any Person pursues, that we can determine his Enjoyment, but merely from the Passion with which he pursues it, and the Success he meets with in his Pursuit.  Objects have absolutely no Worth or Value in themselves.  They derive their Worth merely from the Passion.  If that be strong, and steady, and successful, the Person is happy.  It cannot reasonably be doubted, but a little Miss, drest in a new Gown for a Dancing-School Ball, receives as compleat Enjoyment as the greatest Orator, who triumphs in the Splendor of his Eloquence, while he governs the Passions and Resolutions of a numerous Assembly.

ALL the Difference, therefore, betwixt one Man and another, with regard to Life, consists either in the _Passion_, or in the _Enjoyment_:  And these Differences are sufficient to produce the wide Extremes of Happiness and Misery.

TO be happy, the _Passions_ must neither be too violent, nor too remiss.  In the first Case, the Mind is in a perpetual Hurry and Fluster; in the second, it sinks into a disagreeable Indolence and Lethargy.

TO be happy, the Passions must be benign and social; not rough or fierce.  The Affections of the latter Kind are not near so agreeable, to the Feeling, as those of the former.  Who will compare Rancour and Animosity, Envy and Revenge, to Friendship, Benignity, Clemency and Gratitude?

TO be happy, the Passions must be chearful and gay, not gloomy and melancholy.  A Propensity to Hope and Joy is real Riches:  One to Fear and Sorrow, real Poverty.

SOME Passions or Inclinations, in the _Enjoyment_ of their Object, are not so steady or constant as others, nor convey such a durable Pleasure and Satisfaction.  _Philosophical Devotion_, for Instance, like the Enthusiasm of a Poet, is the transitory Effect of high Spirits, great Leisure, a fine Genius, and a Habit of Study and Contemplation:  But notwithstanding all these Circumstances, an abstracted, invisible Object, like that which _natural_ Religion alone presents to us, cannot long actuate the Mind, or be of any Moment in Life.  To render the Passion of Continuance, we must find some Method of affecting the Senses and Imagination, and must embrace some _historical_ as well as _philosophical_ Accounts of the Divinity.  Popular Superstitions and Observances are even found to be of Use in this Particular.

THO' the Tempers of Men be very different, yet we may safely pronounce in general, that a Life of Pleasure cannot support itself so long as one of Business, but is much more subject to Satiety and Disgust.  The Amusements, which are the most durable, have all a Mixture of Application and Attention in them; such as Gaming and Hunting.  And in general, Business and Action fill up all the great Vacancies of human Life.

BUT where the Temper is the best dispos'd for any _Enjoyment_, the Object is often wanting:  And in this respect, the Passions, which pursue _external_ Objects, do not contribute so much to Happiness, as those which rest in ourselves; since we are neither so certain of attaining such Objects, nor so secure of possessing them.  A Passion for Learning is preferable, with regard to Happiness, to one for Riches. SOME Men are possest of great Strength of Mind; and even when they pursue _external_ Objects, are not much affected by a Disappointment, but renew their Application and Industry with the greatest Chearfulness.  Nothing contributes more to Happiness than this Turn of Mind.

ACCORDING to this short and imperfect Sketch of human Life, the happiest Disposition of Mind is the _virtuous_; or, in other Words, that which leads to Action and Employment, renders us sensible to the social Passions, steels the Heart against the Assaults of Fortune, reduces the Affections to a just Moderation, makes our own Thoughts an Entertainment to us, and inclines us rather to the Pleasures of Society and Conversation, than to those of the Senses.  This, in the mean Time, must be obvious to the most careless Reasoner, that all Dispositions of Mind are not alike favourable to Happiness, and that one Passion or Humour may be extremely desirable, while another is equally hateful.  And indeed, all the Difference betwixt the Conditions of Life depends upon the Mind; nor is there any Situation of Affairs, in itself, preferable to another.  Good and Ill, both natural and moral, are entirely relative to human Sentiments and Affections.  No Man wou'd ever be unhappy, cou'd he alter his Feelings.  _Proteus_-like, he wou'd elude all Attacks, by the continual Alterations of his Shape and Form.

BUT this Resource Nature has, in a great Measure, depriv'd us of.  The Fabric and Constitution of our Mind no more depends on our Choice, than that of our Body.  The Generality of Men have not even the smallest Notion, that any Alteration in this Respect can ever be desirable.  As a Stream necessarily follows the several Inclinations of the Ground, on which it runs; so are the ignorant and thoughtless Part of Mankind actuated by their natural Propensities.  Such are effectually excluded from all Pretensions to Philosophy, and the _Medicine of the Mind_, so much boasted.  But even upon the wise and thoughtful, Nature has a prodigious Influence; nor is it always in a Man's Power, by the utmost Art and Industry, to correct his Temper, and attain that virtuous Character, to which he aspires.  The Empire of Philosophy extends over a few; and with Regard to these too, her Authority is very weak and limited.  Men may well be sensible of the Value of Virtue, and may desire to attain it; but 'tis not always certain, that they will be successful in their Wishes.

WHOEVER considers, without Prejudice, the Course of human Actions, will find, that Men are almost entirely guided by Constitution and Temper, and that general Maxims have little Influence, but so far as they affect our Taste or Sentiment.  If a Man have a lively Sense of Honour and Virtue, with moderate Passions, his Conduct will always be conformable to the Rules of Morality; or if he depart from them, his Return will be easy and expeditious.  But, on the other Hand, where one is born of so perverse a Frame of Mind, of so callous and insensible a Disposition, as to have no Relish for Virtue and Humanity, no Sympathy with his Fellow-creatures, no Desire of Esteem and Applause; such a one must be allow'd to be entirely incurable, nor is there any Remedy in Philosophy.  He reaps no Satisfaction but from low and sensual Objects, or from the Indulgence of malignant Passions:  He feels no Remorse to controul his vicious Inclinations:  He has not even that Sense or Taste, which is requisite to make him desire a better Character:  For my Part, I know not how I should address myself to such a one, or by what Arguments I shou'd endeavour to reform him. Shou'd I tell him of the inward Satisfaction that results from laudable and human Actions, the delicate Pleasures of disinterested Love and Friendship, the lasting Enjoyments of a good Name and an established Character; he might still reply, that these were, perhaps, Pleasures to such as were susceptible of them; but that, for his Part, he finds himself of a quite different Turn and Disposition.  I must repeat it; my Philosophy affords no Remedy in such a Case, nor cou'd I do any Thing but lament this Person's unhappy Condition.  But then I ask, If any other Philosophy can afford a Remedy; or if it be possible, by any System, to render all Mankind virtuous, however perverse may be their natural Frame of Mind?  Experience will soon convince us of the contrary; and I will venture to affirm, That, perhaps, the chief Benefit, which results from Philosophy, arises in an indirect Manner.  'Tis certain, that a serious Application to the Sciences and liberal Arts, softens and humanizes the Temper, and cherishes those fine Emotions, in which true Virtue and Honour consists.  It rarely, very rarely happens, that a Man of Taste and Learning is not, at least, an honest Man, whatever Frailties may attend him.  The Bent of his Mind to speculative Studies must mortify in him the Passions of Interest and Ambition, and must, at the same Time, give him a greater Sensibility of all the Decencies and Duties of Life.  He feels more fully a moral Distinction in Characters and Manners; nor is his Sense of this Kind diminish'd, but, on the contrary, it is much encreas'd, by his Speculations.

BESIDES such insensible Changes upon the Temper and Disposition, 'tis highly probable, that others may be produc'd by Study and Application.  The prodigious Effects of Education may convince us, that the Mind is not altogether stubborn and inflexible, but will admit of many Alterations from its original Make and Structure.  Let a Man propose to himself the Model of a Character, which he approves of; let him be well acquainted with those Particulars, in which his own Character deviates from this Model:  Let him keep a constant Watch over himself, and bend his Mind, by a continual Effort, from the Vices towards the Virtues; and I doubt not but, in Time, he will find, in his Temper, an Alteration to the better.

HABIT is another powerful Means of reforming the Mind, and implanting in it good Dispositions and Inclinations.  A Man who continues for some Time in a Course of Sobriety and Temperance, will hate Riot and Disorder:  If he engage himself in Business or Study, Indolence will seem a Punishment to him:  If he constrain himself to practise Beneficence and Affability, he will soon abhor all Instances of Pride and Violence.  Where one is throughly convinc'd, that the virtuous Course of Life is preferable; if he has but Resolution enough to impose a Violence on himself for some Time; his Reformation need not be despair'd of.  The Misfortune is, that this Conviction and this Resolution never can have Place, unless a Man be, before hand, tolerably virtuous. HERE then is the utmost Triumph of Art and Philosophy:  It insensibly refines the Temper, and it points out to us those Dispositions which we shou'd endeavour to attain, by a constant _Bent_ of Mind, and by repeated _Habit_.  Beyond this I cannot acknowledge its Influence; and I must entertain great Doubts concerning all those Exhortations and Consolations, which are in such Vogue among all speculative Reasoners.

WE have already observ'd, That no Objects are, of themselves, desirable or odious, valuable or despicable; but that all Objects acquire these Qualities from the particular Character and Constitution of the Mind, which surveys them.  To diminish, therefore, or augment any Person's Value for an Object, to excite or moderate his Passions, there are no direct Arguments or Reasons, which can be imploy'd with any Force or Influence.  The catching Flies, like _Domitian_, if it give more Pleasure, is preferable to the hunting wild Beasts, like _William Rufus_, or conquering Kingdoms, like _Alexander_. BUT tho' the Value of every Object can be determin'd only by the Sentiments or Passions of every Individual, we may observe, That the Passions, in pronouncing their Verdict, consider not the Object simply, as it is in itself, but survey it with all the Circumstances that attend it.  A Man transported with Joy, on Account of his possessing a Diamond, confines not his View to the glistering Stone before him:  He also considers its Rarity, and from thence chiefly arises his Pleasure and Exultation.  Here therefore a Philosopher may step in, and suggest particular Views and Considerations, and Circumstances, which otherwise wou'd have escap'd us; and, by that Means, he may either moderate or excite any particular Passion.

IT may seem unreasonable absolutely to deny the Authority of Philosophy in this Respect:  But it must be confest, that there lyes this strong Presumption against it, That if these Views be natural and obvious, they wou'd have occur'd of themselves, without the Assistance of Philosophy; if they be not natural, they can never have any Influence on the Affections.  _These_ are of a very delicate Nature, and cannot be forced or constrained by the utmost Art and Industry.  A Consideration, which we seek for on Purpose, which we enter into with Difficulty, which we retain with Care and Attention, can never produce those genuine and durable Movements of Passion, which are the Result of Nature, and the Constitution of the Mind.  A Man may as well pretend to cure himself of Love, by viewing his Mistress thro' the _artificial_ Medium of a Microscope, or Prospect, and beholding there the Coarseness of her Skin, and monstrous Disproportion of her Features, as hope to excite or moderate any Passion by the _artificial_ Arguments of a _Seneca_ or an _Epictetus_.  The Remembrance of the natural Aspect and Situation of the Objects will, in both Cases, still return upon him.  The Reflections of Philosophy are too subtile and distant to take Place in common Life, or eradicate any Affection.  The Air is too fine to breathe in, where it is above the Winds and Clouds of the Atmosphere.

ANOTHER Defect of those Reflections, which Philosophy presents to us, is, That commonly they cannot diminish or extinguish our vicious Passions, without diminishing or extinguishing such as are virtuous, and rendering the Mind totally indifferent and inactive.  They are, for the most Part, general, and are applicable to all our Affections.  In vain do we hope to direct their Influence only to one Side.  If by incessant Study and Meditation we have rendered them very intimate and present to us, they will operate throughout, and spread an universal Insensibility over the Mind.  When we destroy the Nerves, we extinguish the Sense of Pleasure, along with that of Pain.

IT will be easy, by one Glance of the Eye, to find one or other of these Defects in most of those philosophical Reflections, so much celebrated both in antient and modern Times.  _Let not the Injuries or Violence of Men_, says _Marcus Aurelius_, _ever discompose you by Anger or Hatred.  Would you be angry at the Ape for its Malice, or the Tyger for its Ferocity_?  This Reflection leads us into a bad Opinion of human Nature, and must extinguish the social Affections.  It tends also to remove all Remorse for a Man's own Crimes, when he considers, that Vice is as natural to Mankind, as the particular Instincts to Brute-Creatures. _ALL Ills arise from the Order of the Universe, which is absolutely perfect.  Wou'd you wish to disturb so divine an Order for the Sake of your own particular Interest_.  What if the Ills I suffer arise from Malice or Oppression?  /But the Vices and Imperfections of Men are also comprehended in the Order of the Universe.

If Plagues and Earthquakes break not Heav'ns Design, Why then a\ Borgia _or a_ Cataline?

Let this be allow'd; and my own Vices will also be a Part of the same Order.

_MAN is born to be miserable; and is he surpriz'd at any particular Misfortune?  And can he give Way to Sorrow and Lamentation upon Account of any Disaster_?  Yes: He very reasonably laments, that he shou'd be born to be miserable.  Your Consolation presents a hundred Ills for one, that you pretend to ease him of.

_YOU shou'd always have before your Eyes Death, Disease, Poverty, Blindness, Exile, Calumny, and Infamy, as Ills which are incident to human Nature.  When any of these Ills falls to your Lot, you will bear it the better that you have laid your Account with it_. I answer, If we confine ourselves to a general and distant Reflection on the Ills of human Life, _that_ can have no Effect to prepare us for them.  If by close and intense Meditation we render them present and intimate to us, _that_ is the true Secret to poison all our Pleasures, and render us perpetually miserable.

_YOUR Sorrow is fruitless, and will not change the Course of Destiny_.  Very true:  And for that very Reason I am sorry.

_CICERO_'s Consolation for Deafness is somewhat curious.  _How many Languages are there_, says he, _which you do not understand?  The_ Punic, Spanish, Gallic, AEgyptian, _&c.  With regard to all these, you are as if you were deaf, and yet you are indifferent about the Matter.  Is it then so great a Misfortune to be deaf to one Language more_ <2>?

I LIKE better the Repartee of _Antipater_ the _Cyreniac_, when some Women were condoling with him for his Blindness.  _What_! says he, _Do you think there are no Pleasures in the Dark_? _NOTHING can be more destructive_, says _Fontenelle, to Ambition, and the Passion for Conquests, than the true System of Astronomy.  What a poor Thing is even the whole Globe, in Comparison of the infinite Extent of Nature_?  This Consideration is evidently too distant ever to have any Effect.  And if it had any, wou'd it not destroy Patriotism as well as Ambition?  The same gallant Author adds with some Reason, that the bright Eyes of the Ladies are the only Objects, which lose nothing of their Lustre or Value from the most extensive Views of Astronomy and Philosophy, but stand Proof against every System.  Wou'd Philosophers advise us to limit our Affection to them?

THERE are only two Considerations to be met with in Books of Philosophy, from which any Effect is to be expected; and that because these two Considerations alone are drawn from common Life, and occur upon the most superficial View of human Affairs.  When we consider the Shortness and Uncertainty of Life, how frivolous do all our Pursuits of Happiness appear?  And even, if we wou'd extend our Concern beyond our own Life, how frivolous do our most enlarg'd and most generous Projects appear, when we consider the incessant Changes and Revolutions of human Affairs, by which Laws and Learning, Books and Governments are hurry'd away by Time, as by a rapid Stream, and are lost in the immense Ocean of Matter?  Such a Reflection does certainly tend to mortify all our Passions:  But does it not thereby counter-work the Artifice of Nature, who has happily deceiv'd us into an Opinion, that human Life is of some Importance?  And may not such a Reflection be imploy'd with Success by voluptuous Reasoners, to lead us from the Paths of Action and Virtue, into the flowery Fields of Indolence and Pleasure?

WE are inform'd by _Thucydides_, that, during the famous Plague of _Athens_, when Death seem'd present to every one's Eyes, a dissolute Mirth and Gaiety prevail'd among the People, who exhorted one another to make the most of Life as long as it endur'd.  The same Principle makes Soldiers, during War, to be more addicted to Riot and Expence, than any other Race of Men: And 'tis observable, in this Kingdom, that long Peace, by producing Security, has much alter'd them in this Particular, and has quite remov'd our Officers from the generous Character of their Profession.

THE _second_ Philosophical Consideration, which may often have an Influence on the Affections, is deriv'd from a Comparison of our own Condition with the Condition of others.  This Comparison we are continually making, even in common Life; but the Misfortune is, that we are apt rather to compare our Situation with that of our Superiors, than with that of our Inferiors.  A Philosopher corrects this natural Infirmity, by turning his View to the other Side, in order to render himself easy in the Situation wherein Fortune has plac'd him.  There are few People, who are not susceptible of some Consolation from this Reflection; tho', to a very good-natur'd Man, the View of human Miseries shou'd rather produce Sorrow than Comfort, and add to his Lamentations for his own Misfortunes a deep Compassion for those of others.  Such is the Imperfection, even of the best of these philosophical Topics of Consolation. I SHALL conclude this Subject with observing, That tho' Virtue be undoubtedly the best Choice, when it is attainable; yet such is the Disorder and Confusion of human Affairs, that no perfect Oeconomy or regular Distribution of Happiness and Misery is ever, in this Life, to be expected.  Not only the Goods of Fortune, and the Endowments of the Body, (both which are of great Importance) not only these Advantages, I say, are unequally divided betwixt the virtuous and vicious, but even the Mind itself partakes, in some Degree, of this Disorder, and the most worthy Character, by the very Oeconomy of the Passions, does not always enjoy the highest Felicity.

'TIS observable, that tho' every bodily Disease or Pain proceeds from some Disorder in the Parts, yet the Pain is not always proportion'd to the Disorder; but is greater or less, according to the greater or less Sensibility of the Part, upon which the noxious Humours exert their Influence.  A _Tooth-ach_ produces more violent Convulsions of Pain, than a _Phthisis_, or a _Dropsy_.  In like Manner, with regard to the Constitution of the Mind, we may observe, that all Vice is indeed pernicious; but yet the Disturbance or Pain is not measur'd out by Nature with exact Proportion to the Degrees of Vice, nor is the Man of highest Virtue, even abstracting from external Accidents, always the most happy.  A gloomy and melancholy Disposition is certainly, _to our Sentiments_, a Vice or Imperfection; but as it may be accompany'd with a great Sense of Honour and great Integrity, it may be found in very worthy Characters; tho' 'tis sufficient alone to imbitter Life, and render the Person affected with it compleatly miserable.  On the other Hand, a selfish Villain may possess a Spring and Alacrity of Temper, a certain _Gaiete de coeur_, which is indeed a good Quality, but which is rewarded much beyond its Merit, and when attended with good Fortune, will compensate the Uneasiness and Remorse arising from all the other Vices.

I SHALL add, as an Observation to the same Purpose, that if a Man be liable to a Vice or Imperfection, it may often happen, that a good Quality, which he possesses along with it, will render him more miserable, than if he were compleatly vicious.  A Person of such a Weakness and Imbecillity of Temper, as to be easily broke by Affliction, is more unhappy for being endow'd with a generous and friendly Disposition, which gives him a lively Concern for others, and exposes him the more to Fortune and Accidents.  A Sense of Shame, in an imperfect Character, is certainly a Virtue, but produces great Uneasiness and Remorse, from which the abandon'd Villain is intirely free.  A very amorous Complexion, with a Heart incapable of Friendship, is happier than the same Excess in Love, with a Generosity of Temper, which transports a Man beyond himself, and renders him a total Slave to the Object of his Passion.

IN a Word, Human Life is more govern'd by Fortune than by Reason; is to be regarded more as a dull Pastime than as a serious Occupation; and is more influenc'd by particular Humour than by general Principles.  Shall we engage ourselves in it with Passion and Anxiety?  It is not worthy of so much Concern.  Shall we be indifferent about what happens?  We lose all the Pleasure of the Game by our Phlegm and Carelessness.  While we are reasoning concerning Life, Life is gone; and Death, tho' _perhaps_ they receive him differently, yet treats alike the Fool and the Philosopher.  To reduce Life to exact Rule and Method, is commonly a painful, oft a fruitless Occupation:  And is it not also a Proof, that we over-value the Prize we contend for?  Even  to reason so carefully concerning it, and to fix with Accuracy its just Idea, would be over-valuing it, were it not that, to some Tempers, this Occupation is one of the most amusing, in which Life cou'd possibly be imploy'd.

Notes

1.  Were I not afraid of appearing too philosophical, I wou'd remind my Reader of that famous Doctrine, suppos'd to be fully prov'd in modern Times, _That Tastes and Colours, and all other sensible Qualities, ly not in the Bodies, but merely in the Senses_.  The Case is the same with Beauty and Deformity, Virtue and Vice.  This Doctrine, however, takes off no more from the Reality of the latter Qualities, than from that of the former; nor need it give any Umbrage either to Critics or Moralists.  Tho' Colours were allow'd to ly only in the Eye, wou'd Dyers or Painters ever be less regarded or esteem'd?  There is a sufficient Uniformity in the Senses and Feelings of Mankind, to make all these Qualities the Objects of Art and Reasoning, and to have the greatest Influence on Life and Manners.  And as 'tis certain, that the Discovery above-mention'd in natural Philosophy, makes no Alteration on Action and Conduct; Why shou'd a like Discovery in moral Philosophy make any Alteration?

ESSAY X.

_Of_ POLYGAMY _and_ DIVORCES.

AS Marriage is an Engagement enter'd into by mutual Consent, and, having for its End the Propagation of the Species, 'tis evident it must be susceptible of all the Variety of Conditions, which mutual Consent establishes, provided they be not contrary to this End.

A MAN, in conjoining himself to a Woman, is bound to her according to the Terms of his Engagement:  In begetting Children, he is bound, by all the Laws of Nature and Humanity, to provide for their Subsistence and Education.  When he has perform'd these two Parts of his Duty, no Being can reproach him with Injustice or Injury.  And as the Terms of his Engagement, as well as the Methods of subsisting his Offspring, may be very various, 'tis mere Superstition to imagine, that Marriage can be intirely uniform, and will admit only of one Mode or Form.  Did not human Laws restrain the natural Liberty of Men, every particular Marriage wou'd be as different from another, as Contracts or Bargains of any other Kind or Species.

AS Circumstances vary, and the Laws propose different Advantages, we find, that, in different Times and Places, they impose different Conditions on this important Contract.  In _Tonquin_ 'tis usual for the Sailors, when the Ships come into the Harbour, to marry for the Season; and, notwithstanding this precarious Engagement, they are assur'd of the strictest Fidelity to their Bed, as well as in the whole Management of their Affairs, from those temporary Spouses.

I CANNOT, at present, recollect my Authorities; but I have somewhere read, That the Republic of _Athens_, having lost many of its Citizens by War and Pestilence, allow'd every Man to marry two Wives, in order the sooner to repair the Waste which had been made by these Calamities.  The Poet _Euripides_, happen'd to be coupled to two ugly Vixons, who so plagu'd him with their Jealousies and Quarrels, that he became ever after a profest _Woman-hater_; and is the only theatrical Writer, perhaps the only Poet, that ever entertain'd an Aversion against the whole Sex.

IN that agreeable Romance, call'd _the History of the Sevarambians_, where a great many Men and a few Women are suppos'd to be shipwreck'd on a desert Coast; the Captain of the Troop, in order to obviate those endless Quarrels that arose, regulates their Marriages after the following Manner:  He takes a handsome Female to himself alone; assigns one to every couple of inferior Officers; and to five of the lowest Rank he gives one Wife in common.  Cou'd the greatest Legislator, in such Circumstances, have contriv'd Matters with greater Wisdom?

THE antient _Britons_ had a very singular Kind of Marriage, which is to be met with among no other People.  Any Number of them, as ten or a dozen, join'd in a Society together, which was perhaps requisite for mutual Defence in those barbarous Times.  In order to link this Society the closer, they took an equal Number of Wives in common, and whatever Children were born, were reputed to belong to all of them, and were accordingly provided for by the whole Community.

AMONG the inferior Creatures, Nature herself, being the supreme Legislator, prescribes all the Laws which regulates their Marriages, and varies those Laws according to the different Circumstances of the Creature.  Where she furnishes, with Ease, Food and Defence to the new-born Animal, the present Embrace terminates the Marriage; and the Care of the Offspring is committed intirely to the Female.  Where the Food is of more difficult Purchase, the Marriage continues for one Season, till the common Progeny can provide for itself; and then the Link immediately dissolves, and leaves each of the Parties free to enter into a new Engagement at the ensuing Season.  But Nature having endow'd Man with Reason, has not so exactly regulated every Article of his Marriage-contract, but has left him to adjust them, by his own Prudence, according to his particular Circumstances and Situation.  Municipal Laws are a Supply to the Wisdom of each Individual; and, at the same Time, by restraining the natural Liberty of Men, make the private Interest submit to the Interest of the Public.  All Regulations, therefore, on this Head are equally lawful, and equally conformable to the Principles of Nature; tho' they are not all equally convenient, or equally useful to Society.  The Laws may allow of Polygamy, as among the _Eastern_ Nations; or of voluntary Divorces, as among the _Greeks_ and _Romans_; or they may confine one Man to one Woman, during the whole Course of their Lives, as among the modern _Europeans_.  It may not be disagreeable to consider the Advantages and Disadvantages of each of these Institutions.

THE Advocates for Polygamy may recommend it as the only effectual Remedy for the Furies and Disorders of Love, and the only Expedient for freeing Men from that Slavery to the Females, which the natural Violence of our Passions has impos'd on us.  By this Means alone can we regain our Right of Sovereignty; and, by sating our Appetite, re-establish the Authority of Reason in our Minds, and, of Consequence, our own Authority in our Families.  Man, like a weak Sovereign, being unable to support himself against the Wiles and Intrigues of his Subjects, must play one Faction against another, and become absolute by the mutual Jealousies of the Females.  _To divide and to govern_ is an universal Maxim; and, by neglecting it, the _Europeans_ undergo a more grievous and a more ignominious Slavery than the _Turks_ or _Persians_, who are subjected indeed to a Sovereign, that lyes at a Distance from them, but in their domestic Affairs rule with an uncontroulable Sway.  An honest _Turk_, who should come from his Seraglio, where every one trembles before him, wou'd be surpriz'd to see _Sylvia_ in her drawing Room, ador'd by all the Beaus and pretty Fellows about Town, and he wou'd certainly take her for some mighty and despotic Queen, surrounded by her Guard of obsequious Slaves and Eunuchs.

ON the other Hand, it may be urg'd with better Reason, That this Sovereignty of the Man is a real Usurpation, and destroys that Nearness, not to say Equality of Rank, which Nature has establish'd betwixt the Sexes.  We are, by Nature, their Lovers, their Friends, their Patrons:  Wou'd we willingly change such endearing Appellations for the barbarous Titles of Master and Tyrant?

IN what Capacity shall we gain by this inhuman Proceeding?  As Lovers, or as Husbands?  The _Lover_ is totally annihilated; and Courtship, the most agreeable Scene in human Life, can no longer have Place, where Women have not the free Disposal of themselves, but are bought and sold, like the meanest Animals.  The _Husband_ is as little a Gainer, having found the admirable Secret of extinguishing every Part of Love, except its Jealousy.  There is no Rose without its Thorn; but he must be a foolish Wretch indeed, who throws away the Rose, and preserves only the Thorn.

I WOU'D not willingly insist upon it as an Advantage in our _European_ Customs, what was observ'd by _Mehemet Effendi_ the last _Turkish_ Ambassador in _France_.  _We Turks_, says he, _are great Simpletons in Comparison of the Christians.  We are at the Expence and Trouble of keeping a Seraglio, each in his own House:  But you ease yourselves of this Burden, and have your Seraglio in your Friends Houses_. The known Virtue of our _British_ Ladies free them sufficiently from this Imputation:  And the _Turk_ himself, however great a _Turk_, must own, that our free Commerce with the Fair-Sex, more than any other Invention, embellishes, enlivens, and polishes Society.

BUT the _Asiatic_ Manners are as destructive to Friendship as to Love.  Jealousy excludes Men from all Intimacies and Familiarities.  No Man dare bring his Friend to his House or Table, lest he bring a Lover to his numerous Wives.  Hence all over the East, each Family is as separate from another, as if they were so many distinct Kingdoms.  No Wonder then, that _Solomon_, living like an Eastern Prince, with his seven hundred Wives and three hundred Concubines, without one Friend, cou'd write so pathetically concerning the Vanity of the World.  Had he try'd the Secret of one Wife or Mistress, a few Friends, and a great many Companions, he might have found Life somewhat more agreeable.  Destroy Love and Friendship, what does there remain in the World worth accepting? TO render Polygamy more odious, I need not recount the frightful Effects of Jealousy, and the Constraint in which it holds the Fair-Sex all over the East.  In those Countries Men are not allow'd to have any Commerce with the Females, not even Physicians, when Sickness may be suppos'd to have extinguish'd all wanton Passions in the Bosoms of the Fair, and, at the same Time, has render'd them unfit Objects of Desire.  _Tournefort_ tells us, That when he was brought into the _Grand Seignior_'s Seraglio as a Physician, he was not a little surpriz'd, in looking along a Gallery, to see a great Number of naked Arms, standing out from the Sides of the Room.  He cou'd not imagine what this cou'd mean; 'till he was told, that those Arms belong'd to Bodies, which he must cure, without knowing any more about them, than what he cou'd learn from the Arms:  He was not allow'd to ask a Question of the Patient, or even of her Attendants, lest he might find it necessary to enquire concerning Circumstances, which the Delicacy of the Seraglio allows not to be reveal'd.  Hence the Physicians in the Eastern Countries pretend to know all Diseases from the Pulse; as our Quacks in _Europe_ undertake to cure a Person merely from seeing his Water.  I suppose, had _Monsieur Tournefort_ been of this latter Kind, he wou'd not, in _Constantinople_, have been allow'd by the jealous _Turks_ to be furnish'd with Materials requisite for exercising his Art.

IN another Country, where Polygamy is also allow'd, they render their Wives Cripples, and make their Feet of no Use to them, in order to confine them to their own Houses.  But it will, perhaps, surprize the Reader to hear, that in a _European_ Country, where Polygamy is not allow'd, Jealousy can yet be carried to such a Height, that it is indecent so much as to suppose a Woman of Rank can have Feet or Legs.  A _Spaniard_ is jealous of the very Thoughts of those who approach his Wife; and, if possible, will prevent his being dishonour'd, even by the Wantonness of Imagination.  Witness the following Story, which we have from very good Authority <1>.  When the Mother of the late King of _Spain_ was on her Road towards _Madrid_, she past thro' a little Town in _Spain_, famous for its Manufactory of Gloves and Stockings.  The honest Magistrates of the Place thought they cou'd not better express their Joy, for the Reception of their new Queen, than by presenting her with a Sample of those Commodities, for which alone their Town was remarkable.  The _Major-Domo_ who conducted the Queen, receiv'd the Gloves very graciously:  But when the Stockings were presented, he flung them away with great Indignation, and severely reprimanded the Magistrates for this egregious Piece of Indecency.  _Know_, says he, _That a Queen of_ Spain _has no Legs_.  The poor young Queen, who, at that Time, understood the Language but very imperfectly, and had  been often frighten'd with Stories of _Spanish_ Jealousy, imagin'd they were to cut off her Legs.  Upon which she fell a crying, and begg'd them to conduct her back to _Germany_; for that she never cou'd endure that Operation:  And it was with some Difficulty they cou'd appease her.  _Philip_ IV. is said never in his Life to have laugh'd heartily, but at the Recital of this Story.

IF a _Spanish_ Lady must not be suppos'd to have Legs, what must be suppos'd of a _Turkish_ Lady?  She must not be suppos'd to have a Being at all.  Accordingly, 'tis esteem'd a Piece of Rudeness and Indecency at _Constantinople_, ever to make mention of a Man's Wives before him <2>.  In _Europe_, 'tis true, fine bred People make it also a Rule never to talk of their Wives: But the Reason is not founded on our Jealousy.  I suppose it is because we shou'd be apt, were it not for this Rule, to become troublesome to Company, by talking too much of them.

THE President _Montesquiou_ has given a different Reason for this polite Maxim, _Men_, says he, _never care to mention their Wives in Company, lest they should talk of them before People, that know them better than they do themselves_.

HAVING rejected Polygamy, and match'd one Man with one Woman, let us now consider what Duration we shall assign to their Union, and whether we shall admit of those voluntary Divorces, which were in Use among the _Greeks_ and _Romans_.  They who wou'd defend this Practice, may imploy the following Reasons.

HOW often does Disgust and Aversion arise after Marriage, from the most trivial Accidents, or from an Incompatibility of Humour; where Time, instead of curing the Wounds proceeding from mutual Injuries, does every Day fester them the more, by new Quarrels and Reproaches?  Let us separate Hearts, which are not made for each other.  Each of them may, perhaps, find another, for which it is better fitted:  At least, nothing can be more cruel, than to preserve, by Violence, an Union, which, at first, was made by mutual Love, and is now, in Effect, dissolv'd by mutual Hatred.

BUT the Liberty of Divorces is not only a Cure to Hatred and domestic Quarrels; it is also an admirable Preservative against them, and the only Secret for keeping alive that Love, which first united the marry'd Couple.  The Heart of Man delights in Liberty:  The very Image of Constraint is grievous to it:  When you wou'd confine it by Violence, to what wou'd otherwise have been its Choice, its Inclination immediately changes, and Desire is turn'd into Aversion.  If the public Interest will not allow us to enjoy in Polygamy that _Variety_, which is so agreeable in Love; deprive us not at least of that _Liberty_, which is so essentially requisite.  In vain you tell me, that I had my Choice of the Person, with whom I wou'd conjoin myself.  I had my Choice, 'tis true, of my Prison; but this is but a small Comfort, since it must still be a Prison.

SUCH are the Arguments, which may be urg'd in favour of Divorces:  But there seem to be these three unanswerable Objections against them; _First_, What must become of the Children, upon the Separation of the Parents?  Must they be committed to the Care of a Stepmother; and, instead of the fond Care and Concern of a Mother, feel all the Indifference or Hatred of a Stranger or an Enemy?  These Inconveniences are sufficiently felt, where Nature has made the Divorce by the Doom inevitable to all Mortals:  And shall we seek to multiply these Inconveniences, by multiplying Divorces, and putting it in the Power of Parents, upon every Caprice, to render their Posterity miserable?

_Secondly_, IF it be true, on the one Hand, that the Heart of Man naturally delights in Liberty, and hates every Thing to which it is confin'd; 'tis also true, on the other Hand, that the Heart of Man naturally submits to Necessity, and soon loses an Inclination when there appears an absolute Impossibility of satisfying it.  These Principles of human Nature, you'll say, are contradictory:  But what is Man but a Heap of Contradictions?  Tho' 'tis remarkable, that where Principles are, after this Manner, contrary in their Operation, they do not always destroy each other; but the one or the other may predominate on any particular Occasion, according as Circumstances are more or less favourable to it.  For Instance, Love is a restless and impatient Passion, full of Caprices and Variations; arising in a Moment from a Feature, from an Air, from nothing, and suddenly extinguishing after the same Manner.  Such a Passion requires Liberty above all Things; and therefore _Eloisa_ had Reason, when, in order to preserve this Passion, she refus'd to marry her belov'd _Abelard_. /How oft, when prest to Marriage, have I said,

Curse on all Laws, but those which Love has made.

Love, free as Air, at Sight of human Ties,

Spreads his light Wing, and in a Moment flies\.

But _Friendship_ is a calm and sedate Affection, conducted by Reason, and cemented by Habit; springing from long Acquaintance and mutual Obligations; without Jealousies or Fears, and without those feverish Fits of Heat and Cold, which cause such an agreeable Torment in the amorous Passion.  So sober an Affection, therefore, as Friendship, rather thrives under Constraint, and never rises to such a Height, as when any strong Interest or Necessity binds two Persons together, and gives them some common Object of Pursuit.  Let us consider then, whether Love or Friendship shou'd most predominate in Marriage; and we shall soon determine whether Liberty or Constraint be most favourable to it.  The happiest Marriages, to be sure, are found where Love, by long Acquaintance, is consolidated into Friendship.  Whoever dreams of Raptures and Extasies beyond the Honey-moon, is a Fool.  Even Romances themselves, with all their Liberty of Fiction, are oblig'd to drop their Lovers the very Day of their Marriage, and find it easier to support the Passion for a dozen of Years under Coldness, Disdain and Difficulties, than a Week under Possession and Security.  We need not, therefore, be afraid of drawing the Marriage-knot the closest possible; the Friendship betwixt the Persons, where it is solid and sincere, will rather gain by it:  And where it is wavering and uncertain, this is the best Expedient for fixing it.  How many frivolous Quarrels and Disgusts are there, which People of common Prudence endeavour to forget, when they ly under the Necessity of passing their Lives together; but which wou'd soon inflame into the most deadly Hatred, were they pursu'd to the utmost, under the Prospect of an easy Separation?

IN the _third_ Place, we must consider, that nothing is more dangerous than to unite two Persons so close in all their Interests and Concerns, as Man and Wife, without rendering the Union intire and total.  The least Possibility of a separate Interest must be the Source of endless Quarrels and Jealousies.  What Dr. _Parnel_ calls

_The little pilfering Temper of a Wife_,

will be doubly ruinous; and the Husband's Selfishness, being accompany'd with more Power, may be still more dangerous.

SHOU'D these Reasons against voluntary Divorces be esteem'd insufficient, I hope no Body will pretend to refuse the Testimony of Experience.  At the Time that Divorces were most frequent among the _Romans_, Marriages were most rare; and _Augustus_ was oblig'd, by penal Laws, to force the Men of Fashion of _Rome_ into the married State:  A Circumstance which is scarce to be found in any other Age or Nation.

THE Exclusion of Polygamy and Divorces sufficiently recommends our present _European_ Practice, with Regard to Marriage.

ESSAY XI.

_Of_ SIMPLICITY _and_ REFINEMENT.

FINE Writing, according to Mr. _Addison_, consists of Sentiments, which are natural, without being obvious.  There cannot be a juster, and more concise Definition of fine Writing.

SENTIMENTS, which are merely natural, affect not the Mind with any Pleasure, and seem not worthy to engage our Attention.  The Pleasantries of a Waterman, the Observations of a Peasant, the Ribaldry of a Porter or Hackney-coach Man; all these are natural, and disagreeable.  What an insipid Comedy shou'd we make of the Chit-chat of a Tea-table, copy'd faithfully and at full Length?  Nothing can please Persons of Taste, but Nature drawn with all her Graces and Ornaments, _la belle nature_; or if we copy low Life, the Strokes must be strong and remarkable, and must convey a lively Image to the Mind.  The absurd <1> Naivety of _Sancho Pancho_ is represented in such inimitable Colours by _Cervantes_, that it entertains as much as the Picture of the most magnanimous Hero, or softest Lover.

THE Case is the same with Orators, Philosophers, Critics, or any Author, who speaks in his own Person, without introducing other Speakers or Actors.  If his Language be not elegant, his Observations uncommon, his Sense strong and masculine, he will in vain boast his Nature and Simplicity.  He may be correct; but he never will be agreeable.  'Tis the Unhappiness of such Authors, that they are never blam'd nor censur'd.  The good Fortune of a Book, and that of a Man, are not the same.  The secret deceiving Path of Life, which _Horace_ talks of, _fallentis semita vitae_, may be the happiest Lot of the one; but is the greatest Misfortune that the other can possibly fall into.

ON the other Hand, Productions, which are merely surprising, without being natural, can never give any lasting Entertainment to the Mind.  To draw Chimeras is not, properly speaking, to copy or imitate.  The Justness of the Representation is lost, and the Mind is displeas'd to find a Picture, which bears no Resemblance to any Original.  Nor are such excessive Refinements more agreeable in the epistolary or philosophic Stile than in the Epic or Tragic.  Too much Ornament is a Fault in every Kind of Production.  Uncommon Expressions, strong Flashes of Wit, pointed Similies, and epigrammatic Turns, especially when laid too thick, are a Disfigurement, rather than any Embellishment of Discourse.  As the Eye, in surveying a _Gothic_ Building, is distracted by the Multiplicity of Ornaments, and loses the whole by its minute Attention to the Parts; so the Mind, in perusing a Work over-stock'd with Wit, is fatigu'd and disgusted with the constant Endeavour to shine and surprize.  This is the Case where a Writer over-abounds in Wit, even tho' that Wit, in itself, shou'd be just and agreeable.  But it commonly happens to such Writers, that they seek for their favourite Ornaments, even where the Subject affords them not; and, by that Means, have twenty insipid Conceits for one Thought that is really beautiful.

THERE is no Subject in critical Learning more copious than this of the just Mixture of Simplicity and Refinement in Writing; and therefore, not to wander in too large a Field, I shall confine myself to a few general Observations on that Head.

_First_, I observe, _That tho' the Excesses of both Kinds are to be avoided, and tho' a proper Medium ought to be study'd in all Productions; yet this Medium lyes not in a Point, but admits of a very considerable Latitude_.  Consider the wide Distance, in this Respect, betwixt Mr. _Pope_ and _Lucretius_.  These seem to ly in the two greatest Extremes of Refinement and Simplicity, which a Poet can indulge himself in, without being guilty of any blameable Excess.  All this Interval may be fill'd with Poets, who may differ from each other, but may be equally admirable, each in his peculiar Stile and Manner.  _Corneille_ and _Congreve_, who carry their Wit and Refinement somewhat farther than Mr. _Pope_ (if Poets of so different a Kind can be compar'd together) and _Sophocles_ and _Terence_, who are more simple than _Lucretius_, seem to have gone out of that Medium, wherein the most perfect Productions are to be found, and are guilty of some Excess in these opposite Characters.  Of all the great Poets, _Virgil_ and _Racine_, in my Opinion, ly nearest the Center, and are the farthest remov'd from both the Extremities.

MY _second_ Observation on this Head is, _That it is very difficult, if not impossible, to explain, by Words, wherein the just Medium betwixt the Excesses of Simplicity and Refinement consists, or to give any Rule, by which we can know precisely the Bounds betwixt the Fault and the Beauty_.  A Critic may not only discourse very judiciously on this Head, without instructing his Readers, but even without understanding the Matter perfectly himself.  There is not in the World a finer Piece of Criticism than _Fontenelle's Dissertation on Pastorals_; wherein, by a Number of Reflections and philosophical Reasonings, he endeavours to fix the just Medium, which is suitable to that Species of Writing.  But let any one read the Pastorals of that Author, and he will be convinc'd, that this judicious Critic, notwithstanding his fine Reasonings, had a false Taste, and fix'd the Point of Perfection much nearer the Extreme of Refinement, than pastoral Poetry will admit of.  The Sentiments of his Shepherds are better suited to the Toilettes of _Paris_, than to the Forests of _Arcadia_.  But this it is impossible to discover from his critical Reasonings.  He blames all excessive Painting and Ornament as much as _Virgil_ cou'd have done, had _he_ wrote a Dissertation on this Species of Poetry.  However different the Tastes of Men may be, their general Discourses on these Subjects are commonly the same.  No Criticism  can be very instructive, which descends not to Particulars, and is not full of Examples and Illustrations.  'Tis allow'd on all Hands, that Beauty, as well as Virtue, lyes always in a Medium; but where this Medium is plac'd, is the great Question, and can never be sufficiently explain'd by general Reasonings.

I SHALL deliver it as a _third_ Observation on this Subject, _That we ought to be more on our Guard against the Excess of Refinement than that of Simplicity; and that because the former Excess is both less_ beautiful, _and more_ dangerous _than the latter_.

'TIS a certain Rule, That Wit and Passion are intirely inconsistent.  When the Affections are mov'd, there is no Place for the Imagination.  The Mind of Man being naturally limited, 'tis impossible all its Faculties can operate at once:  And the more any one predominates, the less Room is there for the others to exert their Vigour.  For this Reason, a greater Degree of Simplicity is requir'd in all Compositions, where Men, and Actions, and Passions are painted, than in such as consist of Reflections and Observations.  And as the former Species of Writing is the more engaging and beautiful, one may safely, upon this Account, give the Preference to the Extreme of Simplicity above that of Refinement.

WE may also observe, That those Compositions, which we read the oftenest, and which every Man of Taste has got by Heart, have the Recommendation of Simplicity, and have nothing surprizing in the Thought, when divested of that Elegance of Expression, and Harmony of Numbers, with which it is cloath'd.  If the Merit of the Composition lyes in a Point of Wit; it may strike at first; but the Mind anticipates the Thought in the second Perusal, and is no longer affected by it.  When I read an Epigram of _Martial_, the first Line recals the Whole; and I have no Pleasure in repeating to myself what I know already.  But each Line, each Word in _Catullus_ has its Merit; and I am never tir'd with the Perusal of him.  'Tis sufficient to run over _Cowley_ once:  But _Parnel_, after the fiftieth Reading, is as fresh as at the first.  Besides, 'tis with Books, as with Women, where a certain Plainness of Manner and of Dress is more engaging than that Glare of Paint and Airs and Apparel, which may dazle the Eye, but reaches not the Affections.  _Terence_ is a modest and bashful Beauty, to whom we grant every Thing, because he assumes nothing, and whose Purity and Nature, make a durable, tho' not a violent, Impression upon us.

BUT Refinement, as it is the less _beautiful_, so it is the more _dangerous_ Extreme, and what we are the aptest to fall into.  Simplicity passes for Dulness, when it is not accompany'd with great Elegance and Propriety.  On the

contrary, there is something surprizing in a Blaze of Wit and Conceit.  Ordinary Readers are mightily struck with it, and falsly imagine it to be the most difficult, as well as most excellent Way of Writing.  _Seneca_ abounds with agreeable Faults, says _Quinctilian_, _abundat dulcibus vitiis_; and for that Reason is the more dangerous, and the more apt to pervert the Taste of the young and inconsiderate.

I SHALL add, That the Excess of Refinement is now more to be guarded against than ever; because 'tis the Extreme, which Men are the most apt to fall into, after Learning has made great Progress, and after eminent Writers have appear'd in every Species of Composition.  The Endeavour to please by Novelty, leads Men wide of Nature and Simplicity, and fills their Writings with Affectation and Conceit.  'Twas thus the Age of _Claudius_ and _Nero_ became so much inferior to that of _Augustus_ in Taste and Genius:  And perhaps there are, at present, many Symptoms of a like Degeneracy of Taste, in _France_ as well as in _England_.

ESSAY I.

_Of_ ESSAY-WRITING.

THE elegant Part of Mankind, who are not immers'd in the animal Life, but employ themselves in the Operations of the Mind, may be divided into the _learned_ and _conversible_.  The Learned are such as have chosen for their Portion the higher and more difficult Operations of the Mind, which require Leisure and Solitude, and cannot be brought to Perfection, without long Preparation and severe Labour.  The conversible World join to a sociable Disposition, and a Taste of Pleasure, an Inclination to the easier and more gentle Exercises of the Understanding, to obvious Reflections on human Affairs, and the Duties of common Life, and to the Observation of the Blemishes or Perfections of the particular Objects, that surround them.  Such Subjects of Thought furnish not sufficient Employment in Solitude, but require the Company and Conversation of our Fellow-Creatures,  to render them a proper Exercise for the Mind:  And this brings Mankind together in Society, where every one displays his Thoughts and Observations in the best Manner he is able, and mutually gives and receives Information, as well as Pleasure.

THE Separation of the Learned from the conversible World seems to have been the great Defect of the last Age, and must have had a very bad Influence both on Books and Company:  For what Possibility is there of finding Topics of Conversation fit for the Entertainment of rational Creatures, without having Recourse sometimes to History, Poetry, Politics, and the more obvious Principles, at least, of Philosophy?  Must our whole Discourse be a continued Series of gossipping Stories and idle Remarks?  Must the Mind never rise higher, but be perpetually

/Stun'd and worn out with endless Chat

Of WILL did this, and NAN said that\.

THIS wou'd be to render the Time spent in Company the most unentertaining, as well as the most unprofitable Part of our Lives. ON the other Hand, Learning has been as great a Loser by being shut up in Colleges and Cells, and secluded from the World and good Company.  By that Means, every Thing of what we call _Belles Lettres_ became totally barbarous, being cultivated by Men without any Taste of Life or Manners, and without that Liberty and Facility of Thought and Expression, which can only be acquir'd by Conversation.  Even Philosophy went to Wrack by this moaping recluse Method of Study, and became as chimerical in her Conclusions as she was unintelligible in her Stile and Manner of Delivery.  And indeed, what cou'd be expected from Men who never consulted Experience in any of their Reasonings, or who never search'd for that Experience, where alone it is to be found, in common Life and Conversation?

'TIS with great Pleasure I observe, That Men of Letters, in this Age, have lost, in a great Measure, that Shyness and Bashfulness of Temper, which kept them at a Distance from Mankind; and, at the same Time, That Men of the World are proud of borrowing from Books their most agreeable Topics of  Conversation.  'Tis to be hop'd, that this League betwixt the learned and conversible Worlds, which is so happily begun, will be still farther improv'd to their mutual Advantage; and to that End, I know nothing more advantageous than such _Essays_ as these with which I endeavour to entertain the Public.  In this View, I cannot but consider myself as a Kind of Resident or Ambassador from the Dominions of Learning to those of Conversation; and shall think it my constant Duty to promote a good Correspondence betwixt these two States, which have so great a Dependence on each other.  I shall give Intelligence to the Learned of whatever passes in Company, and shall endeavour to import into Company whatever Commodities I find in my native Country proper for their Use and Entertainment.  The Balance of Trade we need not be jealous of, nor will there be any Difficulty to preserve it on both Sides.  The Materials of this Commerce must chiefly be furnish'd by Conversation and common Life:  The manufacturing of them alone belongs to Learning.

AS 'twou'd be an unpardonable Negligence in an Ambassador not to pay his Respects to  the Sovereign of the State where he is commission'd to reside; so it wou'd be altogether inexcusable in me not to address myself, with a particular Respect, to the Fair Sex, who are the Sovereigns of the Empire of Conversation.  I approach them with Reverence; and were not my Countrymen, the Learned, a stubborn independent Race of Mortals, extremely jealous of their Liberty, and unaccustom'd to Subjection, I shou'd resign into their fair Hands the sovereign Authority over the Republic of Letters.  As the Case stands, my Commission extends no farther, than to desire a League, offensive and defensive, against our common Enemies, against the Enemies of Reason and Beauty, People of dull Heads and cold Hearts.  From this Moment let us pursue them with the severest Vengeance:  Let no Quarter be given, but to those of sound Understandings and delicate Affections; and these Characters, 'tis to be presum'd, we shall always find inseparable.

TO be serious, and to quit the Allusion before it be worn thread-bare, I am of Opinion, that Women, that is, Women of Sense and Education (for to such alone I address myself)  are much better Judges of all polite Writing than Men of the same Degree of Understanding; and that 'tis a vain Pannic, if they be so far terrify'd with the common Ridicule that is levell'd against learned Ladies, as utterly to abandon every Kind of Books and Study to our Sex.  Let the Dread of that Ridicule have no other Effect, than to make them conceal their Knowledge before Fools, who are not worthy of it, nor of them.  Such will still presume upon the vain Title of the Male Sex to affect a Superiority above them:  But my fair Readers may be assur'd, that all Men of Sense, who know the World, have a great Deference for their Judgment of such Books as ly within the Compass of their Knowledge, and repose more Confidence in the Delicacy of their Taste, tho' unguided by Rules, than in all the dull Labours of Pedants and Commentators.  In a neighbouring Nation, equally famous for good Taste, and for Gallantry, the Ladies are, in a Manner, the Sovereigns of the _learned_ World, as well as of the _conversible_; and no polite Writer pretends to venture upon the Public, without the Approbation of some celebrated Judges of that Sex.  Their Verdict is, indeed, sometimes complain'd of; and, in particular,  I find, that the Admirers of _Corneille_, to save that great Poet's Honour upon the Ascendant that _Racine_ began to take over him, always said, That it was not to be expected, that so old a Man could dispute the Prize, before such Judges, with so young a Man as his Rival.  But this Observation has been found unjust, since Posterity seems to have ratify'd the Verdict of that Tribunal:  And _Racine_, tho' dead, is still the Favourite of the Fair Sex, as well as of the best Judges among the Men.

THERE is only one Subject, on which I am apt to distrust the Judgment of Females, and that is, concerning Books of Gallantry and Devotion, which they commonly affect as high flown as possible; and most of them seem more delighted with the Warmth, than with the justness of the Passion.  I mention Gallantry and Devotion as the same Subject, because, in Reality, they become the same when treated in this Manner; and we may observe, that they both depend upon the very same Complexion.  As the Fair Sex have a great Share of the tender and amorous Disposition, it perverts their Judgment on this Occasion, and makes them be easily affected, even by  what has no Propriety in the Expression nor Nature in the Sentiment.  Mr. _Addison_'s elegant Discourses of Religion have no Relish with them, in Comparison of Books of mystic Devotion:  And _Otway_'s Tragedies are rejected for the Rants of Mr. _Dryden_.

WOU'D the Ladies correct their false Taste in this Particular; Let them accustom themselves a little more to Books of all Kinds:  Let them give Encouragement to Men of Sense and Knowledge to frequent their Company:  And finally, let them concur heartily in that Union I have projected betwixt the learned and conversible Worlds.  They may, perhaps, meet with more Complaisance from their usual Followers than from Men of Learning; but they cannot reasonably expect so sincere an Affection:  And, I hope, they will never be guilty of so wrong a Choice, as to sacrifice the Substance to the Shadow.

ESSAY III.

_Of_ MORAL PREJUDICES.

THERE is a Set of Men lately sprung up amongst us, who endeavour to distinguish themselves by ridiculing every Thing, that has hitherto appear'd sacred and venerable in the Eyes of Mankind.  Reason, Sobriety, Honour, Friendship, Marriage, are the perpetual Subjects of their insipid Raillery:  And even public Spirit, and a Regard to our Country, are treated as chimerical and romantic.  Were the Schemes of these Anti-reformers to take Place, all the Bonds of Society must be broke, to make Way for the Indulgence of a licentious Mirth and Gaiety:  The Companion of our drunken Frollics must be prefer'd to a Friend or Brother:  Dissolute Prodigality must be supply'd at the Expence of every Thing valuable, either in public or private:  And Men shall have so little Regard to any Thing beyond themselves, that, at last, a free Constitution of Government must become  a Scheme perfectly impracticable among Mankind, and must degenerate into one universal System of Fraud and Corruption.

THERE is another Humour, which may be observ'd in some Pretenders to Wisdom, and which, if not so pernicious as the idle petulant Humour above-mention'd, must, however, have a very bad Effect on those, who indulge it.  I mean that grave philosophic Endeavour after Perfection, which, under Pretext of reforming Prejudices and Errors, strikes at all the most endearing Sentiments of the Heart, and all the most useful Byasses and Instincts, which can govern a human Creature.  The _Stoics_ were remarkable for this Folly among the Antients; and I wish some of more venerable Characters in latter Times had not copy'd them too faithfully in this Particular.  The virtuous and tender Sentiments, or Prejudices, if you will, have suffer'd mightily by these Reflections; while a certain sullen Pride or Contempt of Mankind has prevail'd in their Stead, and has been esteem'd the greatest Wisdom; tho', in Reality, it be the most egregious Folly of all others.  _Statilius_ being sollicited by _Brutus_ to make one of that noble Band,  who struck the GOD-like Stroke for the Liberty of _Rome_, refus'd to accompany them, saying, _That all Men were Fools or Mad, and did not deserve that a wise Man should trouble his Head about them_.

MY learned Reader will here easily recollect the Reason, which an antient Philosopher gave, why he wou'd not be reconcil'd to his Brother, who sollicited his Friendship.  He was too much a Philosopher to think, that the Connexion of having sprung from the same Parent, ought to have any Influence on a reasonable Mind, and exprest his Sentiment after such a Manner as I think not proper to repeat.  When your Friend is in Affliction, says _Epictetus_, you may counterfeit a Sympathy with him, if it give him Relief; but take Care not to allow any Compassion to sink into your Heart, or disturb that Tranquillity, which is the Perfection of Wisdom.  _Diogenes_ being askt by his Friends in his Sickness, What should be done with him after his Death?  _Why_, says he, _throw me out into the Fields_.  "What! reply'd they, to the Birds or Beasts."  _No:  Place a Cudgel by me, to defend myself withal_.  "To what Purpose, say they, you will not have  any Sense, nor any Power of making Use of it."  _Then if the Beasts shou'd devour me_, cries he, _shall I be any more sensible of it_?  I know none of the Sayings of that Philosopher, which shews more evidently both the Liveliness and Ferocity of his Temper.

HOW different from these are the Maxims by which _Eugenius_ conducts himself!  In his Youth he apply'd himself, with the most unwearied Labour, to the Study of Philosophy; and nothing was ever able to draw him from it, except when an Opportunity offer'd of serving his Friends, or doing a Pleasure to some Man of Merit.  When he was about thirty Years of Age, he was determin'd to quit the free Life of a Batchelor (in which otherwise he wou'd have been inclin'd to remain) by considering, that he was the last Branch of an antient Family, which must have been extinguish'd had he died without Children.  He made Choice of the virtuous and beautiful _Emira_ for his Consort, who, after being the Solace of his Life for many Years, and having made him the Father of several Children, paid at last the general Debt to Nature.  Nothing cou'd have supported him under so severe  an Affliction, but the Consolation he receiv'd from his young Family, who were now become dearer to him on account of their deceast Mother.  One Daughter in particular is his Darling, and the secret Joy of his Soul; because her Features, her Air, her Voice recal every Moment the tender Memory of his Spouse, and fill his Eyes with Tears.  He conceals this Partiality as much as possible; and none but his intimate Friends are acquainted with it.  To them he reveals all his Tenderness; nor is he so affectedly Philosophical, as even to call it by the Name of _Weakness_.  They know, that he still keeps the Birth-day of _Emira_ with Tears, and a more fond and tender Recollection of past Pleasures; in like Manner as it was celebrated in her Lifetime with Joy and Festivity.  They know, that he preserves her Picture with the utmost Care, and has one Picture in Minature, which he always wears next to his Bosom:  That he has left Orders in his last Will, that, in whatever Part of the World he shall happen to die, his Body shall be transported, and laid in the same Grave with her's:  And that a Monument shall be erected over them, and their mutual Love and  Happiness celebrated in an Epitaph, which he himself has compos'd for that Purpose.

A FEW Years ago I receiv'd a Letter from a Friend, who was abroad on his Travels, and shall here communicate it to the Public.  It contains such an Instance of a Philosophic Spirit, as I think pretty extraordinary, and may serve as an Example, not to depart too far from the receiv'd Maxims of Conduct and Behaviour, by a refin'd Search after Happiness or Perfection.  The Story I have been since assur'd of as Matter of Fact.

SIR,_Paris Aug. 2. 1737_.

I KNOW you are more curious of Accounts of Men than of Buildings, and are more desirous of being inform'd of private History than of public Transactions; for which Reason, I thought the following Story, which is the common Topic of Conversation in this City, wou'd be no unacceptable Entertainment to you.

A YOUNG Lady of Birth and Fortune, being left intirely at her own Disposal, persisted long in a Resolution of leading a single Life, notwithstanding  several advantageous Offers that had been made to her.  She had been determin'd to embrace this Resolution, by observing the many unhappy Marriages among her Acquaintance, and by hearing the Complaints, which her Female Friends made of the Tyranny, Inconstancy, Jealousy or Indifference of their Husbands.  Being a Woman of strong Spirit and an uncommon Way of thinking, she found no Difficulty either in forming or maintaining this Resolution, and cou'd not suspect herself of such Weakness, as ever to be induc'd, by any Temptation, to depart from it.  She had, however, entertain'd a strong Desire of having a Son, whose Education she was resolv'd to make the principal Concern of her Life, and by that Means supply the Place of those other Passions, which she was resolv'd for ever to renounce.  She push'd her Philosophy to such an uncommon Length, as to find no Contradiction betwixt such a Desire and her former Resolution; and accordingly look'd about, with great Deliberation, to find, among all her Male-Acquaintance, one whose Character and Person were agreeable to her, without being able to satisfy herself on that Head.  At Length, being in  the Play-house one Evening, she sees in the _Parterre_, a young Man of a most engaging Countenance and modest Deportment; and feels such a Pre-possession in his Favour, that she had Hopes this must be the Person she had long sought for in vain.  She immediately dispatches a Servant to him; desiring his Company, at her Lodgings, next Morning.  The young Man was over-joy'd at the Message, and cou'd not command his Satisfaction, upon receiving such an Advance from a Lady of so great Beauty, Reputation and Quality.  He was, therefore, much disappointed, when he found a Woman, who wou'd allow him no Freedoms; and amidst all her obliging Behaviour, confin'd and over-aw'd him to the Bounds of rational Discourse and Conversation.  She seem'd, however, willing to commence a Friendship with him; and told him, that his Company wou'd always be acceptable to her, whenever he had a leisure Hour to bestow.  He needed not much Entreaty to renew his Visits, being so struck with her Wit and Beauty, that he must have been unhappy, had he been debarr'd her Company.  Every Conversation serv'd only the more to inflame his Passion, and gave him more Occasion to admire her Person and Understanding, as well as to rejoice in his own Good-fortune.  He was not, however, without Anxiety, when he consider'd the Disproportion of their Birth and Fortune; nor was his Uneasiness allay'd even when he reflected on the extraordinary Manner in which their Acquaintance had commenc'd.  Our Philosophical Heroine, in the mean Time, discover'd, that her Lover's personal Qualities did not belye his Phisiognomy; so that, judging there was no Occasion for any farther Trial, she takes a proper Opportunity of communicating to him her whole Intention.  Their Intercourse continu'd for sometime, till at last her Wishes were crown'd, and she was now Mother of a Boy, who was to be the Object of her future Care and Concern.  Gladly wou'd she have continu'd her Friendship with the Father; but finding him too passionate a Lover to remain within the Bounds of Friendship, she was oblig'd to put a Violence upon herself.  She sends him a Letter, in which she had inclos'd a Bond of Annuity for a Thousand Crowns; desiring him, at the same Time, never to see her more, and to forget, if possible, all past Favours and Familiarities.  He was Thunder-struck at receiving this Message; and, having tried, in vain, all the Arts that might win upon the Resolution of a Woman, resolv'd at last to attack her by her _Foible_.  He commences a Law-suit against her before the Parliament of _Paris_; and claims his Son, whom he pretends a Right to educate as he pleas'd, according to the usual Maxims of the Law in such Cases.  She pleads, on the other Hand, their express Agreement before their Commerce, and pretends, that he had renounc'd all Claim to any Offspring that might arise from their Embraces.  It is not yet known, how the Parliament will determine in this extraordinary Case, which puzzles all the Lawyers, as much as it does the Philosophers.  As soon as they come to any Issue, I shall inform you of it, and shall embrace any Opportunity of subscribing myself, as I do at present.

SIR,

_Your most humble Servant_.

ESSAY IV.

_Of the_ MIDDLE STATION _of_ LIFE.

THE Moral of the following Fable will easily discover itself, without my explaining it.  One Rivulet meeting another, with whom he had been long united in strictest Amity, with noisy Haughtiness and Disdain thus bespoke him, "What, Brother! Still in the same State!  Still low and creeping!  Are you not asham'd, when you behold me, who, tho' lately in a like Condition with you, am now become a great River, and shall shortly be able to rival the _Danube_ or the _Rhine_, provided those friendly Rains continue, which have favour'd my Banks, but neglected yours."  Very true, replies the humble Rivulet; "You are now, indeed, swoln to great Size:  But methinks you are become, withal, somewhat turbulent and muddy.  I am contented with my low Condition and my Purity." INSTEAD of commenting upon this Fable, I shall take Occasion, from it, to compare the different Stations of Life, and to perswade such of my Readers as are plac'd in the Middle Station to be satisfy'd with it, as the most eligible of all others.  These form the most numerous Rank of Men, that can be suppos'd susceptible of Philosophy; and therefore, all Discourses of Morality ought principally to be address'd to them.  The Great are too much immers'd in Pleasure; and the Poor too much occupy'd in providing for the Necessities of Life, to hearken to the calm Voice of Reason.  The Middle Station, as it is most happy in many Respects, so particularly in this, that a Man, plac'd in it, can, with the greatest Leisure, consider his own Happiness, and reap a new Enjoyment, from comparing his Situation with that of Persons above or below him.

_AGUR_'s Prayer is sufficiently noted.  _Two Things have I requir'd of thee, deny me them not before I die, Remove far from me Vanity and Lies; Give me neither Poverty nor Riches, feed me with Food convenient for me:  Lest I be full and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord?  Or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the Name of  my GOD in vain_.  The middle Station is here justly recommended, as affording the fullest _Security_ for Virtue; and I may also add, that it gives Opportunity for the most ample _Exercise_ of it, and furnishes Employment for every good Quality, which we can possibly be possest of.  Those, who are plac'd among the lower Rank of Men, have little Opportunity of exerting any other Virtue, besides those of Patience, Resignation, Industry and Integrity.  Those, who are advanc'd into the higher Stations, have full Employment for their Generosity, Humanity, Affability and Charity.  When a Man lyes betwixt these two Extremes, he can exert the former Virtues towards his _Superiors_, and the latter towards his _Inferiors_.  Every moral Quality, which the human Soul is susceptible of, may have its Turn, and be called up to Action:  And a Man may, after this Manner, be much more certain of his Progress in Virtue, than where his good Qualities lye dormant, and without Employment.

But there is another Virtue, that seems principally to ly among _Equals_, and is, for that Reason, chiefly calculated for the middle Station of Life.  This Virtue is FRIENDSHIP. I believe most Men of generous Tempers are apt to envy the Great, when they consider the large Opportunities such Persons have of doing Good to their Fellow-creatures, and of acquiring the Friendship and Esteem of Men of Merit.  They make no Advances in vain, and are not oblig'd to associate with those whom they have little Kindness for; like People of inferior Stations, who are subject to have their Proffers of Friendship rejected, even where they wou'd be most fond of placing their Affections.  But tho' the Great have more Facility in acquiring Friendships, they cannot be so certain of the Sincerity of them, as Men of a lower Rank; since the Favours, they bestow, may acquire them Flattery, instead of Good-will and Kindness.  It has been very judiciously remark'd, that we attach ourselves more by the Services we perform than by those we receive, and that a Man is in Danger of losing his Friends by obliging them too far.  I shou'd, therefore, chuse to ly in the middle Way, and to have my Commerce with my Friend varied both by Obligations given and receiv'd.  I have too much Pride to be willing that all the Obligations should ly on my Side; and shou'd be afraid, that, if they all lay on his, he wou'd also have too much Pride to be entirely easy under them, or have a perfect Complacency in my Company.

We may also remark of the middle Station of Life, that it is more favourable to the acquiring of _Wisdom_ and _Ability_, as well as of _Virtue_, and that a Man so situate has a better Chance for attaining a Knowledge both of Men and Things, than those of a more elevated Station.  He enters, with more Familiarity, into human Life:  Every Thing appears in its natural Colours before him:  He has more Leisure to form Observations; and has, beside, the Motive of Ambition to push him on in his Attainments; being certain, that he can never rise to any Distinction or Eminence in the World, without his own Industry.  And here I cannot forbear communicating a Remark, which may appear somewhat extraordinary, _viz_.  That 'tis wisely ordain'd by Providence, that the middle Station shou'd be the most favourable to the improving our natural Abilities, since there is really more Capacity requisite to perform the Duties of that Station, than is requisite to act in the higher Spheres of Life.  There are more natural Parts, and a stronger Genius requisite to make a good Lawyer or Physician, than to make a great Monarch.  For let us take any Race or Succession of Kings, where Birth alone gives a Title to the Crown:  The _English_ Kings, for Instance; who have not been esteemed the most shining in History.  From the Conquest to the Succession of his present Majesty, we may reckon twenty eight Sovereigns, omitting those who died Minors.  Of these, eight are esteem'd Princes of great Capacity, _viz_. the _Conqueror_, _Harry_ II. _Edward_ I.  _Edward_ III. _Harry_ V. and VII. _Elisabeth_, and the late King _William_.  Now, I believe every one will allow, that, in the common Run of Mankind, there are not eight out of twenty eight, who are fitted, by Nature, to make a Figure either on the Bench or at the Bar.  Since _Charles_ VII. ten Monarchs have reign'd in _France_, omitting _Francis_ II.  Five of these have been esteem'd Princes of Capacity, _viz. Louis_ XI. XII. and XIV. _Francis_ I. and _Harry_ IV.  In short, the governing of Mankind well, requires a great deal of Virtue, Justice, and Humanity, but not a surprising Capacity.  A certain Pope, whose Name I have forgot, us'd to say, _Let us divert ourselves, my Friends, the World governs itself_.  There are, indeed, some critical Times, such as those in which _Harry_ IV. liv'd, that call for the utmost Vigour; and a less Courage and Capacity, than what appear'd in that great Monarch, must have sunk under the Weight.  But such Circumstances are rare; and even then, Fortune does, at least, one Half of the Business.

Since the common Professions, such as Law or Physic, require equal, if not superior Capacity, to what are exerted in the higher Spheres of Life, 'tis evident, that the Soul must be made of still a finer Mold, to shine in Philosophy or Poetry, or in any of the higher Parts of Learning.  Courage and Resolution are chiefly requisite in a Commander:  Justice and Humanity in a Statesman:  But Genius and Capacity in a Scholar.  Great Generals, and great Politicians, are found in all Ages and Countries of the World, and frequently start up, at once, even amongst the greatest Barbarians.  _Sweden_ was sunk in Ignorance, when it produc'd _Gustavus Ericson_, and _Gustavus-Adolphus_:  _Muscovy_, when the _Czar_ appear'd:  And, perhaps, _Carthage_, when it gave Birth to _Hannibal_.  But _England_ must pass thro' a long Gradation of its _Spencers, Johnsons, Wallers, Drydens_, before it arrive at an _Addison_ or a _Pope_.  A happy Talent for the liberal Arts and Sciences, is a Kind of Prodigy among Men.  Nature must afford the richest Genius that comes from her Hands; Education and Example must cultivate it from the earliest Infancy; And Industry must concur to carry it to any Degree of Perfection.  No Man needs be surprised to see _Kouli-Kan_ among the _Persians_:  But _Homer_, in so early an Age, among the _Greeks_, is certainly Matter of the highest Wonder.

A Man cannot show a Genius for War, who is not so fortunate as to be trusted with Command; and it seldom happens, in any State or Kingdom, that several, at once, are plac'd in that Situation.  How many _Marlboroughs_ were there in the confederate Army, who never rose so much as to the Command of a Regiment?  But I am perswaded, there has been but one _Milton_ in _England_ within these hundred Years; because every one may exert the Talents for Poetry who is possest of them; and no one cou'd exert them under greater Disadvantages than that divine Poet.  If no Man were allow'd to write Verses, but who was, before-hand, nam'd to be _laureat_, cou'd we expect a Poet in ten thousand Years?

Were we to distinguish the Ranks of Men by their Genius and Capacity more, than by their Virtue and Usefulness to the Public, great Philosophers wou'd certainly challenge the first Rank, and must be plac'd at the Top of human Kind.  So rare is this Character, that, perhaps, there has not, as yet, been above two in the World, who can lay a just Claim to it.  At least, _Galileo_ and _Newton_ seem to me so far to excel all the rest, that I cannot admit any other into the same Class with them.

GREAT Poets may challenge the second Place; and this Species of Genius, tho' rare, is yet much more frequent than the former.  Of the _Greek_ Poets that remain, _Homer_ alone seems to merit this Character:  Of the _Romans, Virgil, Horace_ and _Lucretius_:  Of the _English, Milton_ and _Pope_:  _Corneille, Racine, Boileau_ and _Voltaire_ of the _French_:  And _Tasso_ and _Ariosto_ of the _Italians_. Great Orators and Historians are, perhaps, more rare than great Poets:  But as the Opportunities for exerting the Talents requisite for Eloquence, or acquiring the Knowledge requisite for writing History, depend, in some Measure, upon Fortune, we cannot pronounce these Productions of Genius to be more extraordinary than the former.

I SHOULD now return from this Digression, and show, that the middle Station of Life is more favourable to _Happiness_, as well as to _Virtue_ and _Wisdom_:  But as the Arguments, that prove this, seem pretty obvious, I shall here forbear insisting on them.

ESSAY XII.

_A Character of Sir_ ROBERT

WALPOLE.

THERE never was a Man, whose Actions and Character have been more earnestly and openly canvassed, than those of the present Minister, who, having govern'd a learn'd and free Nation for so long a Time, amidst such mighty Opposition, may make a large Library of what has been wrote for and against him, and is the Subject of above Half the Paper that has been blotted in this Nation within these Twenty Years.  I wish, for the Honour of our Country, that any one Character of him had been drawn with such _Judgment_ and _Impartiality_, as to have some Credit with Posterity, and to show, that our Liberty has, once at least, been imploy'd to good Purpose.  I am only afraid of failing in the former Quality of Judgment:  But if it shou'd be so, 'tis but one Page more thrown away, after an hundred Thousand, upon the same Subject, that have perish'd, and become useless.  In the mean Time, I shall flatter myself with the pleasing Imagination, that the following Character will be adopted by future Historians.

SIR _ROBERT WALPOLE_, Prime Minister of _Great Britain_, is a Man of Ability, not a Genius; good natur'd, not virtuous; constant, not magnanimous; moderate, not equitable <1>.  His Virtues, in some Instances, are free from the Allay of those Vices, which usually accompany such Virtues:  He is a generous Friend, without being a bitter Enemy.  His Vices, in other Instances, are not compensated by those Virtues which are nearly ally'd to them:  His Want of Enterprise is not attended with Frugality.  The private Character of the Man is better than the public:  His Virtues more than his Vices:  His Fortune greater than his Fame.  With many good Qualities he has incurr'd the public Hatred:  With good Capacity he has not escap'd Ridicule.  He would have been esteem'd more worthy of his high Station, had he never possest it; and is better qualify'd for the second than for the first Place in any Government.  His Ministry has been more advantageous to his Family than to the Public, better for this Age than for Posterity, and more pernicious by bad Precedents than by real Grievances.  During his Time Trade has flourish'd, Liberty declin'd, and Learning gone to Ruin.  As I am a Man, I love him; as I am a Scholar, I hate him; as I am a _Briton_, I calmly wish his Fall.  And were I a Member of either House, I wou'd give my Vote for removing him from _St. James_'s; but shou'd be glad to see him retire to _Houghton Hall_, to pass the Remainder of his Days in Ease and Pleasure.

'TIS proper to inform the READER, that, in those ESSAYS, intitled, _The Epicurean, Stoic_, &c. a certain Character is personated; and therefore, no Offence ought to be taken at any Sentiments contain'd in them.

THE Character of Sir ROBERT WALPOLE was drawn some Months ago, when that GREAT MAN was in the Zenith of his Power.  I must confess, that, at present, when he seems to be upon the Decline, I am inclin'd to think more favourably


iv

of him, and to suspect, that the Antipathy, which every true born _Briton_ naturally bears to Ministers of State, inspir'd me with some Prejudice against him.  The impartial READER, if any such there be; or POSTERITY, if such a Trifle can reach them, will best be able to correct my Mistakes in this particular.
