# English Philosophical Texts

_English Philosophical Texts_ is a collection of early English language
philosophical texts published in Britain between 1650 and 1830. It provides the
substance for [Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org) and
[English Philosophical Texts Online](https://englishphilosophy.org), where these
texts can be read and searched.

The texts are stored in [Markit](https://github.com/englishphilosophy/markit)
format, from which they can be automatically converted to structured JSON, with
underlying text marked up as HTML. Refer to the
[Markit](https://github.com/englishphilosophy/markit) repository for further
details.

Note that this project is very much a work in progress. Only around 10% of the
projected corpus has been imported, and many of those texts are still being
checked and edited.
