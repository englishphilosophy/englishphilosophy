# Early English Language Philosophy

Early English Language Philosophy is a project for making a large corpus of
early English philosophical texts freely available, alongisde tools for
interrogating and analysing those texts programmatically.

It consists of:

- [english-philosophical-texts](https://github.com/englishphilosophy/englishphilosophy/tree/main/english-philosophical-texts):
  The corpus itself, and a server for making the texts programmatically
  available and searchable over HTTP.
- [dictionary](https://github.com/englishphilosophy/englishphilosophy/tree/main/dictionary):
  A set of functions to help with searching and analysing the corpus, e.g. by
  normalizing spelling variants.
- [markit](https://github.com/englishphilosophy/englishphilosophy/tree/main/markit):
  A tool for converting texts from the human-readable format in which they are
  stored to JSON and HTML.
- english-philosohpical-text-online (coming soon): A public-facing website for
  reading, searching, and analysing the texts.
- hume-texts-online (coming soon): A public-facing website for reading and
  searching the works of David Hume, including different editions of his works,
  and tools for comparing them.
